The device service can then either:</p> <ol> <li> <p>put the event object on a message bus (which may be implemented via Redis Streams or MQTT).  Subscribers to the event message on the message bus can be application services or core data or both (see step 1.1 below).</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>send the event object to the core data service via REST communications (see step 1.2).</p> <p></p> </li> </ol> <p>When core data receives the event (either via message bus or REST), it persists the sensor data in the local edge database.  EdgeX uses Redis as our persistence store.  There is an abstraction in place to allow you to use another database (which has allowed other databases to be used in the past).  Persistence is not required and can be turned off.  Data is persisted in EdgeX at the edge for two basics reasons:</p> <ul> <li>Edge nodes are not always connected.  During periods of disconnected operations, the sensor data must be saved so that it can be transmitted northbound when connectivity is restored.  This is referred to as store and forward capability.</li> <li>In some cases, analytics of sensor data needs to look back in history in order to understand the trend and to make the right decision based on that history.  If a sensor reports that it is 72\u00b0 F right now, you might want to know what the temperature was ten minutes ago before you make a decision to adjust a heating or cooling system.  If the temperature was 85\u00b0 F, you may decide that adjustments to lower the room temperature you made ten minutes ago were sufficient to cool the room.  It is the context of historical data that are important to local analytic decisions.</li> </ul> <p>When core data receives event objects from the device service via REST, it will put sensor data events on a message topic destined for application services.  Redis Pub/Sub is used as the messaging infrastructure by default (step 2).  MQTT or NATS (opt-in during build) can also be used as the messaging infrastructure between core data and the application services.</p> <p></p> <p>The application service transforms the data as needed and pushes the data to an endpoint.  It can also filter, enrich, compress, encrypt or perform other functions on the event before sending it to the endpoint (step 3).  The endpoint could be an HTTP/S endpoint, an MQTT topic, a cloud system (cloud topic), etc.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"about/#edge-analytics-and-actuation","title":"Edge Analytics and Actuation","text":"<p>In edge computing, simply collecting sensor data is only part of the job of an edge platform like EdgeX.  Another important job of an edge platform is to be able to:</p> <ul> <li>Analyze the incoming sensor data locally</li> <li>Act quickly on that analysis Edge or local analytics is the processing that performs an assessment of the sensor data collected at the edge (\u201clocally\u201d) and triggers actuations or actions based on what it sees.</li> </ul> <p>Why edge analytics?  Local analytics are important for two reasons:</p> <ul> <li>Some decisions cannot afford to wait for sensor collected data to be fed back to an enterprise or cloud system and have a response returned.</li> <li>Additionally, some edge systems are not always connected to the enterprise or cloud \u2013 they have intermittent periods of connectivity.</li> </ul> <p>Local analytics allows systems to operate independently, at least for some stretches of time.  For example: a shipping container\u2019s cooling system must be able to make decisions locally without the benefit of Internet connectivity for long periods of time when the ship is at sea.  Local analytics also allow a system to act quickly in a low latent fashion when critical to system operations.  As an extreme case, imagine that your car\u2019s airbag fired on the basis of data being sent to the cloud and analyzed for collisions.  Your car has local analytics to prevent such a potentially slow and error prone delivery of the safety actuation in your automobile.  </p> <p>EdgeX is built to act locally on data it collects from the edge.  In other words, events are processed by local analytics and can be used to trigger action back down on a sensor/device.</p> <p>Just as application services prepare data for consumption by north side cloud systems or applications, application services can process and get EdgeX events (and the sensor data they contain) to any analytics package (see step 4).  By default, EdgeX ships with a simple rules engine (the default EdgeX rules engine is eKuiper \u2013 an open source rules engine and now a sister project in LF Edge).  Your own analytics package (or ML agent) could replace or augment the local rules engine.</p> <p></p> <p>The analytic package can explore the sensor event data and make a decision to trigger actuation of a device.  For example, it could check that the pressure reading of an engine is greater than 60 PSI.  When such a rule is determined to be true, the analytic package calls on the core command service to trigger some action, like \u201copen a valve\u201d on some controllable device (see step 5).</p> <p></p> <p>The core command service gets the actuation request and determines which device it needs to act on with the request; then calling on the owning device service to do the actuation (see step 6).  Core command allows developers to put additional security measures or checks in place before actuating.</p> <p></p> <p>The device service receives the request for actuation, translates that into a protocol specific request and forwards the request to the desired device (see step 7).</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"about/#project-release-cadence","title":"Project Release Cadence","text":"<p>Typically, EdgeX releases twice a year; once in the spring and once in the fall.

It was initially created to run as the IoT software application on Dell\u2019s introductory line of IoT gateways. Dell entered the project into open source through the Linux Foundation on April 24, 2017. EdgeX was formally announced and demonstrated at Hanover Messe 2017.  Hanover Messe is one of the world's largest industrial trade fairs.  At the fair, the Linux Foundation also announced the association of 50 founding member organizations \u2013 the EdgeX ecosystem \u2013 to help further the project and the goals of creating a universal edge platform.</p> <p>The name \u2018foundry\u2019 was used to draw parallels to Cloud Foundry.  EdgeX Foundry is meant to be a foundry for solutions at the edge just like Cloud Foundry is a foundry for solutions in the cloud.  Cloud Foundry was originated by VMWare (Dell Technologies is a major shareholder of VMWare - recall that Dell Technologies was the original creator of EdgeX).  The \u2018X\u2019 in EdgeX represents the transformational aspects of the platform and allows the project name to be trademarked and to be used in efforts such as certification and certification marks.</p> <p></p> <p>The EdgeX Foundry Logo represents the nature of its role as transformation engine between the physical OT world and the digital IT world.</p> <p>The EdgeX community selected the octopus as the mascot or \u201cspirit animal\u201d of the project at its inception.  Its eight arms and the suckers on the arms represent the sensors.  The sensors bring the data into the octopus.  Actually, the octopus has nine brains in a way.  It has millions of neurons running down each arm; functioning as mini-brains in each of those arms.  The arms of the octopus serve as \u201clocal analytics\u201d like that offered by EdgeX.

To gain that insight of the use of any given feature, we would require not only instrumentation of the code but a central location in the cloud (i.e a TIG stack) for the telemetry to be ingested and in turn reported in order to provide the feedback to the developers. This becomes infeasible primarily because the cloud infrastructure costs, privacy concerns, and other unforeseen legal reasons for sending \u201cUsage Metrics\u201d of an EdgeX installation back to a central entity such as the Linux Foundation, among many others.

The simplest approach would be to leverage configuration following a certain format such as FF_[NewFeatureName]=true/false. This is similar to what is done today. Turning on/off security is an example, turning on/off the registry is another. Expanding this further with a module could offer standardization of controlling a given feature such as <code>featurepkg.Register(\u201cMyNewFeature\u201d)</code> or <code>featurepkg.IsOn(\u201cMyNewFeature\u201d)</code>.

Instead, the decision was to use <code>Writable</code> configuration and allow Consul to be the means to change the configuration (dynamically).  If an adopter chooses not to use Consul, then the configuration with regard to metrics collection, as with all configuration in this circumstance, would be static.  If an external API need is requested in the future (such as from an external UI or tool), a REST API may be added.  See older versions of this PR for ideas on implementation in this case.</li> <li>Per Core Working Group meeting of 2/24/22 (and in many other previous meetings on this ADR) - it was decided that the EdgeX approach should be one of push (via message bus/MQTT) vs. pull (REST API). Both approaches require each service to collect metric telemetry specific to that service.  After collecting it, the service must either push it onto a message topic (as a message) or cache it (into memory or some storage mechanism depending on whether the storage needs to be durable or not) and allow for a REST API call that would cause the data to be pulled from that cache and provided in a response to the REST call.  Given both mechanisms require the same collection process, the belief is that push is probably preferred today by adopters.  In the future, if highly desired, a pull REST API could be added (along with a decision on how to cache the metrics telemetry for that pull). </li> <li>Per Core Working Group meeting of 2/24/22 - importantly, EdgeX is just making the metrics telemetry available on the internal EdgeX message bus.  An adopter would need to create something to pull the data off this bus to use it in some way.  As voiced by several on the call, it is important for the adopter to realize that today, \"we (EdgeX) are not providing the last mile in metrics data\".  The adopter must provide that last mile which is to pick the data from the topic, make it available to their systems and do something with it.</li> <li>Per Core Working Group meeting of 2/24/22 (and in many other previous meetings on this ADR) - it was decided not to use Prometheus (or Prometheus library) as the means to provide for metrics.  The reasons for this are many:<ul> <li>Push vs pull is favored in the first implementation (see point above).  Also see similar debate online for the pluses/minuses of each approach.</li> <li>EdgeX wants to make telemetry data available without dictating the specific mechanism for making the data more widely available.  Specific debate centered on use of Prometheus as a popular collection library (to use inside of services to collect the data) as well as a monitoring system to watch/display the data.  While Prometheus is popular open source approach, it was felt that many organizations choose to use InfluxDB/Grafana, DataDog, AppDynamics, a cloud provided mechanism, or their own home-grown solution to collect, analyse, visualize and otherwise use the telemetry.  Therefore, rather than dictating the selection of the monitoring system, EdgeX would simply make the data available whereby and organization could choose their own monitoring system/tooling.  It should be noted that the EdgeX approach merely makes the telemetry data available by message bus.  A Prometheus approach would provide collection as well as backend system to otherwise collect, analyse, display, etc. the data.  Therefore, there is typically work to be done by the adopter to get the telemetry data from the proposed EdgeX message bus solution and do something with it.</li> <li>There are some <code>reporters</code> that come with go-metrics that allow for data to be taken directly from go-metrics and pushed to an intermediary for Prometheus and other monitoring/telemetry platforms as referenced above.  These capabilities may not be very well supported and is beyond the scope of this EdgeX ADR.  However, even without <code>reporters</code>, it was felt a relatively straightforward exercise (on the part of the adopter) to create an application that listens to the EdgeX metrics message bus and makes that data available via pull REST API for Prometheus if desired.</li> <li>The Prometheus client libraries would have to be added to each service which would bloat the services (although they are available for both Go an C).  The benefit of using go-metrics is that it is used already by Hashicorp Consul (so already in the Go services).</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"design/adr/0006-Metrics-Collection/#implementation-details-for-go","title":"Implementation Details for Go","text":"<p>The go-metrics package offers the following types of metrics collection:</p> <ul> <li>Gauges: holds a single integer (int64) value.<ul> <li>Example use:  Number of notifications in retry status</li> <li>Operations to update the gauge and get the gauge's value</li> <li>Example code:</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <pre><code>g := metrics.NewGauge()\ng.Update(42)  // set the value to 42\ng.Update(10)  // now set the value to 10\nfmt.Println(g.Value())  // print out the current value in the gauge = 10\n</code></pre> <ul> <li>Counter: holds a integer (in64) count.

This version of EdgeX as well as versions through the Fuji release all relied on a bootstrapping service called core-config-seed which was responsible for seeding the configuration of all of the core and support services into Consul prior to any of the services being started.</p> <p>This release actually preceded usage of TOML for configuration files, and instead just used a flat key/value format, with keys converted from legacy Java property names (e.g. meta.db.device.url ) to Camel[Pascal]/Case (e.g. MetaDeviceServiceURL).</p> <p>I chose the config key mentioned above on purpose:</p> <pre><code>MetaDeviceURL = \"http://edgex-core-metadata:48081/api/v1/device\"\n</code></pre> <p>Not only did this config key provide the address of core metadata, it also provided the path of a specific REST endpoint. In later releases of EdgeX, the address of the service and the specific endpoint paths were de-coupled. Instead of following the Service Name design (which was finalized two months earlier), the initial implementation followed the legacy Java implementation and initialized its service clients for each required REST endpoint (belonging to another EdgeX service) directly from the associated *URL config key read from Consul (if enabled) or directly from the configuration file.</p> <p>The shared client initialization code also created an Endpoint monitor goroutine and passed it a go channel channel used by the service to receive updates to the REST API endpoint URL. This monitor goroutine effectively polled Consul every 15s (this became configurable in later versions) for the client's service address and if a change was detected, would write the updated endpoint URL to the given channel, effectively ensuring that the service started using the new URL.</p> <p>It wasn't till late in the Geneva development cycle that I noticed log messages which made me aware of the fact that every one of our services was making a REST call to check the address of a service endpoint every 15s, for every REST endpoint it used!

That is, sensor or device data collected by a device service can be sent via REST or message bus to core data.  Core data then relays the data to application services via message bus, but the sensor data can also be sent directly from device services to application services via message bus (bypassing core data).  The message bus is implemented via Redis Pub/Sub (default) or via MQTT.  From the application services, data can be sent to northside endpoints in any number of ways \u2013 including via MQTT.</p> <p>So, in summary, data can be collected from a sensor or device and be sent from the southside to the northside entirely using message bus technology when desired.</p> <p>Today, communications from a 3rd party system (enterprise application, cloud application, etc.) to EdgeX in order to acuate a device or get the latest information from a sensor is accomplished via REST.  The 3rd party system makes a REST call of the command service which then relays a request to a device service also using REST.  There is no built in means to make a message-based request of EdgeX or the devices/sensors it manages.  Note, these REST calls are optionally made via the API Gateway in order to provide access control.</p> <p>In a future release of EdgeX, there is a desire to allow 3rd party systems to make requests of the southside via message bus.  Specifically, a 3rd party system will send a command request to the command service via external message broker. The command service would then relay the request via message bus to the managing device service via one of the allowed internal message bus implementations (which could be MQTT or Redis Pub/Sub today).  The device service would use the message to trigger action on the device/sensor as it does when it receives a REST request, and respond via message bus back to the command service.  In turn, the command service would relay the response to the 3rd party system via external message bus.</p> <p>In summary, this ADR proposes that the core command service adds support for an external MQTT connection (in the same manner that app services provide an external MQTT connection), which will allow it to act as a bridge between the internal message bus (implemented via either MQTT or Redis Pub/Sub) and external MQTT message bus.</p> <p></p> <p>Note</p> <p>For the purposes of this initial north-to-south message bus communications, external 3rd party communications to the command service will be limited to use of MQTT.</p>"},{"location":"design/adr/0023-North-South-Messaging/#core-command-as-message-bus-bridge","title":"Core Command as Message Bus Bridge","text":"<p>The core command service will serve as the EdgeX entry point for external, north-to-south message bus requests to the south side.</p> <p></p> <p>3rd party systems should not be granted access to the EdgeX internal message bus.

We should implement validation for this message communications.  We should also add validation in REST communications in the future (Levski release??).

Additionally, it was decided to add it to the message envelope.  The reason for this is that when using REST, the path of the request includes the version.

Request id should be returned on the response to a request (providing traceability between single request/response).  Correlation id is used to track across an entire transaction of many service request/responses (providing traceability across a \"transaction\" which is often across many services).

If so should it mimic the REST/HTTP status code responses?  Do we really want to mimic HTTP in our message bus approach?  As suggested by @farshidtz, maybe we should just have an <code>error</code> boolean and then have the message indicate the error condition. <ul> <li>Ans (per monthly architect's meeting of 3/28/22): We will use errorCode to provide the indication of error.  The errorCode will be 0 (no error) or 1 (indicating error) as the two enums for error conditions today.  In the future, if we determine the need for additional errors, we will add more \"enums\" or error code numbers.

When there is no error (errorCode 0) then there is no message string in the payload. </li> </ul> </li> <li>If we have a status code or error code, where does it belong?  In the payload or in the envelope (as it would be in the header in REST)?  As a reference, the IoTAAP MQTT to REST bridge provides a status code to message string translation as an example means to handle this problem.

While not an issue, it is worth calling out that the message bus security paradigm in use is not quite the same as what's provided by the API Gateway, which provides access control for EdgeX. When the API Gateway is used, the security configuration is defined by the EdgeX instance. When an EdgeX service acts as a bridge to an external message bus, if the external bus is properly configured, then any application on the bus can now interact with the EdgeX instance. Thus the security configuration is defined by the external broker, not EdgeX.

As part of this discussion, the question is whether the error code enumerations should be exactly that of the HTTP response codes (400, 404, 423, 500, etc.) or more generic (i.e., non-HTTP) response error codes unique to this implementation.</p> <p>The resolution to this question was to explore some options at implementation time.  The use of an enumeration (HTTP or other) can be explored during development and options brought forth via PR.</p> <p>Info</p> <pre><code>This ADR does not handle securing the message bus communications between services.

All Application Services running receive every Event published, whether they want them or not. The Events can be filtered out using the <code>FilterByDeviceName</code> or <code>FilterByResourceName</code> pipeline functions, but the Application Services still receives every Event and process all the Events to some extent. This could cause load issues in a deployment with many devices and large volume of Events from various devices or a very verbose device that the Application Services is not interested in.</p> <p>Note: The current <code>FilterByDeviceName</code> is only good if the device name is known statically and the only instance of the device defined by the <code>DeviceProfileName</code>. What we really need is <code>FilterByDeviceProfileName</code> which allows multiple instances of a device to be filtered for, rather than a single instance as it it now. The V2 API will be adding <code>DeviceProfileName</code> to the Events, so in Ireland this  filter will be possible.</p> <p>Pub/Sub systems have advanced topic schema, which we can take advantage of from Application Services to filter for just the Events the Application Service actual wants. Publishers of Events must add the <code>DeviceProfileName</code>, <code>DeviceName</code> and <code>SourceName</code> to the topic in the form <code>edgex/events/&lt;device-profile-name&gt;/&lt;device-name&gt;/&lt;source-name&gt;</code>. The <code>SourceName</code> is the <code>Resource</code> or <code>Command</code> name used to create the Event. This allows Application Services to filter for just the Events from the device(s) it wants by only subscribing to those <code>DeviceProfileNames</code> or the specific <code>DeviceNames</code> or just the specific <code>SourceNames</code>  Example subscribe topics if above schema is used:</p> <ul> <li>edgex/events/#</li> <li>All Events </li> <li>Core Data will subscribe using this topic schema</li> <li>edgex/events/Random-Integer-Device/# </li> <li>Any Events from devices created from the Random-Integer-Device device profile</li> <li>edgex/events/Random-Integer-Device/Random-Integer-Device1 </li> <li>Only Events from the Random-Integer-Device1 Device</li> <li>edgex/events/Random-Integer-Device/#/Int16</li> <li>Any Events with Readings from<code>Int16</code> device resource from devices created from the Random-Integer-Device device profile. </li> <li>**edgex/events/Modbus-Device/#/HVACValues</li> <li>Any Events with Readings from <code>HVACValues</code> device command from devices created from the Modbus-Device device profile.</li> </ul> <p>The MessageBus abstraction allows for multiple subscriptions, so an Application Service could specify to receive data from multiple specific device profiles or devices by creating multiple subscriptions. i.e.  <code>edgex/Events/Random-Integer-Device/#</code> and  <code>edgex/Events/Random-Boolean-Device/#</code>. Currently the App SDK only allows for a single subscription topic to be configured, but that could easily be expanded to handle a list of subscriptions. See Configuration section below for details. </p> <p>Core Data's existing publishing of Events would also need to be changed to use this new topic schema. One challenge with this is Core Data doesn't currently know the <code>DeviceProfileName</code> or <code>DeviceName</code> when it receives a CBOR encoded event. This is because it doesn't decode the Event until after it has published it to the MessageBus. Also, Core Data doesn't know of <code>SourceName</code> at all. The V2 API will be enhanced to change the AddEvent endpoint from <code>/event</code> to <code>/event/{profile}/{device}/{source}</code> so that <code>DeviceProfileName</code>, <code>DeviceName</code>, and <code>SourceName</code> are always know no matter how the request is encoded.</p> <p>This new topic approach will be enabled via each publisher's <code>PublishTopic</code> having the <code>DeviceProfileName</code>, <code>DeviceName</code>and <code>SourceName</code>  added to the configured <code>PublishTopicPrefix</code></p> <pre><code>PublishTopicPrefix = \"edgex/events\" # /&lt;device-profile-name&gt;/&lt;device-name&gt;/&lt;source-name&gt; will be added to this Publish Topic prefix\n</code></pre> <p>See Configuration section below for details. </p>"},{"location":"design/adr/013-Device-Service-Events-Message-Bus/#configuration","title":"Configuration","text":""},{"location":"design/adr/013-Device-Service-Events-Message-Bus/#device-services","title":"Device Services","text":"<p>All Device services will have the following additional configuration to allow connecting and publishing to the MessageBus.

This environment variable simply takes a comma separated list of service names.</p> <pre><code>EDGEX_ADD_SECRETSTORE_TOKENS: \"&lt;service-name1&gt;,&lt;service-name2&gt;\"\n</code></pre> <p>If we expanded this to add an optional list of static secret identifiers for each service, i.e.  <code>appservice/redisdb</code>, the exclusive store could also be seeded with a copy of static shared secrets. In this case the Redis database credentials for the Application Services' shared database. The environment variable name will change to <code>ADD_SECRETSTORE</code> now that it is more than just tokens.</p> <pre><code>ADD_SECRETSTORE: \"app-service-xyz[appservice/redisdb]\"\n</code></pre> <p>Note: The secret identifier here is the short path to the secret in the existing appservice <code>SecretStore</code>. In the above example this expands to the full path of <code>/secret/edgex/appservice/redisdb</code></p> <p>The above example results in the Redis credentials being copied into app-service-xyz's <code>SecretStore</code> at <code>/secret/edgex/app-service-xyz/redis</code>.</p> <p>Similar approach could be taken for Message Bus credentials where a common <code>SecretStore</code> is created with the Message Bus credentials saved. The services request the credentials are copied into their exclusive <code>SecretStore</code> using <code>common/messagebus</code> as the secret identifier.</p> <p>Full specification for the environment variable's value is a comma separated list of service entries defined as:</p> <pre><code>&lt;service-name1&gt;[optional list of static secret IDs sperated by ;],&lt;service-name2&gt;[optional list of static secret IDs sperated by ;],...\n</code></pre> <p>Example with one service specifying IDs for static secrets and one without static secrets </p> <pre><code>ADD_SECRETSTORE: \"appservice-xyz[appservice/redisdb; common/messagebus], appservice-http-export\"\n</code></pre> <p>When the <code>ADD_SECRETSTORE</code> environment variable is processed to create these <code>SecretStores</code>, it will copy the specified saved secrets from the initial <code>SecretStore</code> into the service's <code>SecretStore</code>. This all depends on the completion of database or other credential bootstrapping and the secrets having been stored prior to the environment variable being processed. security-secretstore-setup will need to be refactored to ensure this sequencing.</p>"},{"location":"design/adr/014-Secret-Provider-For-All/#abstraction-interface","title":"Abstraction Interface","text":"<p>The following will be the new <code>SecretProvider</code> abstraction interface used by all Edgex services</p> <pre><code>type SecretProvider interface {\n// Stores new secrets into the service's exclusive SecretStore at the specified path.\nStoreSecrets(path string, secrets map[string]string) error\n// Retrieves secrets from the service's exclusive SecretStore at the specified path.\nGetSecrets(path string, _ ...string) (map[string]string, error)\n// Sets the secrets lastupdated time to current time. \nSecretsUpdated()\n// Returns the secrets last updated time\nSecretsLastUpdated() time.Time\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note: The <code>GetDatabaseCredentials</code> and <code>GetCertificateKeyPair</code> APIs have been removed.

In actuality, the full V2 APIs will be delivered in the Ireland release (Spring 2020)</p>"},{"location":"design/adr/core/0003-V2-API-Principles/#context","title":"Context","text":"<p>A redesign of the EdgeX Foundry API is proposed for the Geneva release. This is understood by the community to warrant a 2.0 release that will not be backward compatible. The goal is to rework the API using solid principles that will allow for extension over the course of several release cycles, avoiding the necessity of yet another major release version in a short period of time.</p> <p>Briefly, this effort grew from the acknowledgement that the current models used to facilitate requests and responses via the EdgeX Foundry API were legacy definitions that were once used as internal representations of state within the EdgeX services themselves. Thus if you want to add or update a device, you populate a full device model rather than a specific Add/UpdateDeviceRequest. Currently, your request model has the same definition, and thus validation constraints, as the response model because they are one and the same! It is desirable to separate and be specific about what is required for a given request, as well as its state validity, and the bare minimum that must be returned within a response.</p> <p>Following from that central need, other considerations have been used when designing this proposed API. These will be enumerated and briefly explained below.</p> <p>1.) Transport-agnostic Define the request/response data transfer objects (DTO) in a manner whereby they can be used independent of transport. For example, although an OpenAPI doc is implicitly coupled to HTTP/REST, define the DTOs in such a way that they could also be used if the platform were to evolve to a pub/sub architecture.</p> <p>2.) Support partial updates via PATCH Given a request to, for example, update a device the user should be able to update only some properties of the device. Previously this would require an endpoint for each individual property to be updated since the \"update device\" endpoint, facilitated by a PUT, would perform a complete replacement of the device's data. If you only wanted to update the LastConnected timestamp, then a separate endpoint for that property was required. We will leverage PATCH in order to update an entity and only those properties populated on the request will be considered. Properties that are missing or left blank will not be touched. </p> <p>3.) Support multiple requests at once Endpoints for the addition or updating of data (POST/PATCH) should accept multiple requests at once. If it were desirable to add or update multiple devices with one request, for example, the API should facilitate this.</p> <p>4.) Support multiple correlated responses at once Following from #3 above, each request sent to the endpoint must result in a corresponding response. In the case of HTTP/REST, this means if four requests are sent to a POST operation, the return payload will have four responses. Each response must expose a \"code\" property containing a numeric result for what occurred. These could be equivalent to HTTP status codes, for example. So while the overall call might succeed, one or more of the child requests may not have. It is up to the caller to examine each response and handle accordingly.</p> <p>In order to correlate each response to its original request, each request must be assigned its own ID (in GUID format). The caller can then tie a response to an individual request and handle the result accordingly, or otherwise track that a response to a given request was not received. </p> <p>5.) Use of 207 HTTP Status (Multi-Result) In the case where an endpoint can support multiple responses, the returned HTTP code from a REST API will be 207 (Multi-status)</p> <p>6.) Each service should provide a \"batch\" request endpoint In addition to use-case specific endpoints that you'd find in any REST API, each service should provide a \"batch\" endpoint that can take any kind of request. This is a generic endpoint that allows you to group requests of different types within a single call. For example, instead of having to call two endpoints to get two jobs done, you can call a single endpoint passing the specific requests and have them routed appropriately within the service. Also, when considering agnostic transport, the batch endpoint would allow for the definition and handling of \"GET\" equivalent DTOs which are now implicit in the format of a URL.</p> <p>7.) GET endpoints returning a list of items must support pagination URL parameters must be supported for every GET endpoint to support pagination. These parameters should indicate the current page of results and the number of results on a page.</p>"},{"location":"design/adr/core/0003-V2-API-Principles/#decision","title":"Decision","text":"<p>Commnunity has accepted the reasoning for the new API and the design principles outlined above.

In EdgeX, data collected from sensors are physical quantities which should be associated to some unit of measure to express magnitude of that physical quantity.  For example, if EdgeX collected a temperature reading from a thermostat as <code>45</code>, the user of that sensor reading would want to know if the unit of measure for the <code>45</code> quantity was expressed in Celsius, Fahrenheit or even the Kelvin scale.</p> <p>Since the founding of the project, there has been consensus that a unit of measure should be associated to any sensor or metric quantity collected by EdgeX.  Also since the founding of the project, a unit of measure has therefore been specified (directly or indirectly) to each device resource (found in device profiles) and associated values collected as part of readings.</p> <p>The unit of measure was, however, in all cases just a string reference to some arbitrary unit (which may or may not be in a UoM standard) to be interpreted by the consumer of EdgeX data.  The reporting sensor/device or programmer of the device service could choose what UoM string was associated to the device resources (and readings produced by the device service) as the unit of measure for any piece of data.  Per the temperature example above, the unit of measure could have been \"F\" or \"C\", \"Celsius\" or \"Fahrenheit\", or any other representation.  In other words, the associated unit of measure for all data in EdgeX was left to agreement and interpretation by the data provider/producer and EdgeX data consumer.</p> <p>There are various specifications and standards around unit of measure.  Specifically, there are several options to choose from as it relates to the exchange of data in electronic communications - and units of measure associated in that exchange.  As examples, two big competing standards around EDI (electronic data exchange) that both have associated unit of measure codes are:</p> <ul> <li>ANSI X12: EDI standard used mostly in the US</li> <li>EDIFACT: UN EDI standard used mostly in Europe and Asia</li> </ul> <p>The Unified Code for Units of Measure provides an alternative list (not a standard) that is used by various organizations like OSGI and the Eclipse Foundation.</p> <p>While standards exist, use by various open source projects (especially IoT/edge projects) is inconsistent and haphazard.

Docker Swarm secrets are shared via the <code>/run/secrets</code> volume,    which is a Linux <code>tmpfs</code> volume created on the host and shared with the container.    For an example of Docker Swarm secrets, see the    docker-compose secrets stanza.    Secrets distributed in this manner become part of the RaftDB,    and thus it becomes necessary to enable swarm autolock mode,    which prevents the Raft database encryption key    from being stored plaintext on disk.    Swarm secrets have an additional limitation in that they are not    mutable at runtime.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kubernetes:    Kubernetes is not officially supported by the EdgeX project.    Kubernetes also supports the secrets volume approach,    though the secrets volume can be mounted anywhere in the container namespace.    For an example of Kubernetes secrets volumes, see the    Kubernetes secrets documentation.    Secrets distributed in this manner become part of the <code>etcd</code> database,    and thus it becomes necessary to specify a    KMS provider for data encryption    to prevent <code>etcd</code> from storing plaintext versions of secrets.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"design/adr/security/0008-Secret-Creation-and-Distribution/#consequences","title":"Consequences","text":"<p>As the existing implementation is not fully-compliant with this ADR, significant scope will be added to current and future EdgeX releases in order to bring the project into compliance.</p> <p>List of needed improvements:</p> <ul> <li>PKI private keys</li> <li>All: Move to using Vault as system of origin for the PKI instead of the standalone <code>security-secrets-setup</code> utility.</li> <li>All: Cache the PKI for Consul and Vault on persistent disk; rotate occasionally.</li> <li> <p>All: Investigate hardware protection of cached Consul and Vault PKI secret keys.

Since the client is not in charge of network routing,   TLS server authentication provides a good assurance   that the requests are being routed to the correct server.</p> </li> <li> <p>Server authentication of clients.   The server knows the identity of the client that has connected to it.   There are a variety of mechanims to achieve this,   such as usernames and passwords, tokens, claims, et cetera,   but the mechanism under consideration by this ADR   is TLS client authentication   using TLS client certificates.</p> </li> <li> <p>Confidentiality of messages exchanged between services.   Confidentiality is needed to protect authentication data   flowing between communicating microservices as well as   to protect the message payloads if they contain nonpublic data.   TLS provides communication channel confidentiality.</p> </li> <li> <p>Integrity of messages exchanged between services.   Integrity is needed to ensure that messages between   communicating microservices are not maliciously altered,   such as inserting or deleting data in the middle of the exchange.

An attacker running at the privilege of the operating system has the ability to compromise TLS protections, such as by substituting a private key or certificate authority of their choice, accessing the unencrypted data in process memory, or intercepting the network communications that flow through the kernel.

The following text outlines a proposed strategy for supporting native TLS in the EdgeX framework:</p> <p>EdgeX will use Hashicorp Vault to secure the EdgeX PKI, through the use of the Vault PKI secrets engine. Vault will be configured with a root CA at initialization time, and a Vault-based sub-CA for dynamic generation of TLS leaf certificates. The root CA will be restricted to be used only by the Vault root token.</p> <p>EdgeX microservices that are based on third-party containers require special support unless they can talk natively to Vault for their secrets. Certain tools, such as those mentioned in the \"Creation and Distribution of Secrets\" ADR (<code>envconsul</code>, <code>consul-template</code>, and others) can be used to facilitiate third-party container integration. These services are:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Consul: Requires TLS certificate set by configuration file or command line, with a TLS certificate injected into the container.</p> </li> <li> <p>Vault: As Vault's database is encrypted, Vault cannot natively bootstrap its own TLS certificate.  Requires TLS certificate to be injected into container and its location set in a configuration file.</p> </li> <li> <p>PostgreSQL: Requires TLS certificate to be injected into '$PGDATA' (default: <code>/var/lib/postgresql/data</code>) which is where the writable database files are kept.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kong (admin): Requires environment variable to be set to secure admin port with TLS, with a TLS certificates injected into the container.</p> </li> <li> <p>Kong (external): Requires a bring-your-own (BYO) external certificate, or as a fallback, a default one should be generated using a configurable external hostname.

An access control list limits access   to the keyspace of the key value store.</p> </li> <li> <p>Communication with EdgeX's service registry and configuration provider,   as implemented by Hashicorp Consul, is secured over a local HTTP   socket with token-based authentication,   with the token being mediated by Hashicorp Vault.

An access control list limits the commands   that clients are allowed to issue to the server.</p> </li> </ul> <p>External access to EdgeX microservices has also been secured. EdgeX microservices only bind to local ports, and are only exposed externally through a Kong API gateway. This gateway is configured to use TLS 1.3, using RS256 or ES256 JWT authentication (at the user's discretion). All external requests are filtered at the API gateway. URL rewriting is used to concentrate microservices on a single HTTP-accessible port.</p> <p>Behind the proxy, it is not possible to verify Kong as the origin of local network traffic because mutual-auth TLS is not supported in the open source version of Kong. Although the Kong JWT plugin will set request headers on the backend request that identify the caller, there is no mechanism by which Kong can prove to a backend service that it was the component that performed the authentication step. Even though the original JWT passes through the proxy, the Kong authentication plugins do not expose token introspection endpoints that the backend service could use to check token validity independently.</p> <p>The consequence of having an API gateway that performs all microservice authentication is that communication between EdgeX microservices running behind the API gateway are not authenticated in any way. EdgeX microservices are unable to distinguish malicious traffic that has evaded the API gateway from legitimate microservice traffic.</p>"},{"location":"design/adr/security/0028-authentication/#proposed-design","title":"Proposed Design","text":"<p>This ADR proposes an implementation of the Microservice Authentication UCR that uses a token-based authentication mechanism.</p> <p>This ADR proposes to relieve the Kong API gateway of its JWT management responsibility, and instead use Hashicorp Vault for this purpose, which is already used as EdgeX's secret store. This change requires minimal modification of existing clients written to perform JWT-based authentication at the Kong gateway: they simply use a Vault-issued JWT instead of a Kong-issued JWT or a self-issued JWT.</p> <p>This ADR proposes a layered authentication scheme, with the reverse proxy performing an initial check for all external requests, and EdgeX services themselves authenticating all internal and external requests. There are three reasons for the layered approach:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Authentication at the proxy layer provides a choke point    and policy enforcement points for incoming requests.    By customizing the behavior of the proxy-auth component,    it is possible to allow access to some URLs    and deny access to other URLs based on arbitrary criteria,    such as source IP address, JWT-based claims,    or user identity and role mappings.</p> </li> <li> <p>It means that individual microservices do not immediately    need to implement fine-grained authorization to get the    same effect as having custom policy enforcement at the proxy.</p> </li> <li> <p>It provides defense-in-depth against microservice implementation bugs    and other technical debt that might otherwise put EdgeX    microservices at risk.  Getting a known response to    <code>/core-data/api/v2/ping</code> as a result of an anonymous HTTP request    would positively identify an EdgeX installation.    Similarly, an adopter porting their custom services to EdgeX 3.0    without adding authentication hooks could be vulnerable to outside attacks    that might be mitigated by the additional check at the proxy layer.</p> </li> </ol> <p>EdgeX microservices shall utilize Vault to assess JWT validity and an NGINX reverse proxy shall use the ngx_http_auth_request_module to delegate confirmation of JWT validity. TLS termination at the reverse proxy shall be enabled by default so as to be consistent with ADR 0015 - Encryption between microservices.</p> <p>Behind the proxy, there are two major changes:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Every EdgeX service, when security is enabled,    requires a JWT be passed as part of the HTTP request    that is validated using Vault's token introspection endpoint,    or manually validated based on published signature keys.</p> </li> <li> <p>Every EdgeX service, when security is enabled,    uses a Vault-supplied JWT to authenticate    outgoing calls to peer EdgeX services.

Open-source Vault is used in EdgeX to secure any EdgeX micro service secrets (API keys, passwords, database credentials, service credentials, tokens, certificates etc.).  The Vault secret store serves as the central repository to keep these secrets in an EdgeX deployment.</p> <p>Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and multiple authentication mechanisms (token, LDAP, etc.). Additionally, Vault supports pluggable \"secrets engines\". EdgeX uses three secrets engines today:  key-value secrets engine, Consul secrets engine, and identity secrets engine.  EdgeX uses the Consul secrets engine to allow Vault to issue Consul access tokens to EdgeX microservices. See EdgeX Secret Store for more details.</p> <p>Today, when the secret store is in place and used as the EdgeX secret store, EdgeX requires adopters to use a new instance of Vault provided by the deployment options offered by the EdgeX community (i.e. Docker Compose files, Kubernetes examples, Snaps, etc.).  In other words, EdgeX must totally own the Vault install.</p> <p>In some edge environments where EdgeX may run, Vault is already in place and could be shared by EdgeX.  Additionally, adopters may find several applications running at the edge and want these applications to share a single instance of Vault.  However, having an existing or new instance of Vault that EdgeX uses but does not instantiate and run (a concept the community has called \u201cbringing your own Vault\u201d) is not straightforward.</p> <p>If an adopter wishes to use an instance of Vault that they stand up or pre-exists in their environment, the EdgeX project does not provide any guidance or recipe for how to do this.  While technically possible, it would require a lot of work on the part of the adopter. See the original issue driving this requirement for a potential list of changes that would be required. In short, this is some tedious work and work that is not documented well (or in some cases at all).  It would require an adopter to study the secretstore-setup code and rework or replace the secretstore-setup service with new code to use the existing Vault instance.</p> <p>Therefore, the motivation for this EdgeX change is to make it easier to allow adopters to \u201cbring their own Vault\u201d instance and have EdgeX use that instance without any changes to the overall function of the EdgeX platform.</p>"},{"location":"design/ucr/Bring-Your-Own-Vault/#target-users","title":"Target Users","text":"<p>Any adopter that runs EdgeX in secure mode and with a pre-existing Vault or intention to share a Vault instance among edge applications.</p>"},{"location":"design/ucr/Bring-Your-Own-Vault/#description","title":"Description","text":"<p>Adopters running EdgeX in an environment that has (or will have) an existing Vault instance not setup by EdgeX:</p> <ul> <li>do not want EdgeX to create its own Vault instance</li> <li>want secrets added to the existing instance (the BYOV instance)</li> <li>want the EdgeX micro services (including EdgeX 3rd party services such as the database, API Gateway, etc.) to get their secrets from the existing instance (the BYOV instance)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"design/ucr/Bring-Your-Own-Vault/#existing-solutions","title":"Existing solutions","text":"<p>There are no existing solutions for BYOV.</p>"},{"location":"design/ucr/Bring-Your-Own-Vault/#requirements","title":"Requirements","text":"<p>The basic requirements are straightforward:</p> <ol> <li>Allow EdgeX to seed secrets in a pre-existing or non-EdgeX provided Vault (i.e. the BYO Vault) instance</li> <li>Allow EdgeX services to get/read secrets from the pre-existing or non-EdgeX provided Vault (i.e. the BYO Vault) instance</li> <li>Allow EdgeX services to acquire Consul access tokens from the pre-existing or non-EdgeX provided Vault (i.e. the BYO Vault) instance</li> <li>Allow EdgeX services to acquire identity tokens from the non-EdgeX provided Vault (i.e. the BYO Vault) instance.</li> <li>Support other Vault usages that may be added over time.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"design/ucr/Bring-Your-Own-Vault/#other-related-issues","title":"Other Related Issues","text":""},{"location":"design/ucr/Bring-Your-Own-Vault/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>Issue 1944</li> <li>Vault Project</li> <li>EdgeX Secret Store docs</li> <li>EdgeX Secret Store Setup</li> </ul>"},{"location":"design/ucr/Common%20Configuration/","title":"Common Configuration","text":""},{"location":"design/ucr/Common%20Configuration/#common-configuration","title":"Common Configuration","text":""},{"location":"design/ucr/Common%20Configuration/#submitters","title":"Submitters","text":"<ul> <li>Lenny Goodell (Intel)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"design/ucr/Common%20Configuration/#change-log","title":"Change Log","text":"<ul> <li>approved (2022-12-01)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"design/ucr/Common%20Configuration/#motivation","title":"Motivation","text":"<p>Currently the configuration for all the EdgeX services have many common settings.

The \"If\" informs the rules engine what data to look at and what ranges or values of data must match in order to trigger the \"Then\" part of the statement, which then informs the rules engine what action to take or what external resource to call on, when the data is a match to the \"If\" statement. </p> <p>Most rules engines can be dynamically programmed meaning that new \"If-Then\" statements or rules, can be provided while the engine is running. The rules are often defined by some type of rule language with simple syntax to enable non-Developers to provide the new rules.</p> <p>Rules engines are one of the simplest forms of \"edge analytics\" provided in IoT systems. Rules engines enable data picked up by IoT sensors to be monitored and acted upon (actuated). Typically, the actuation is accomplished on another IoT device or sensor. For example, a temperature sensor in an equipment enclosure may be monitored by a rules engine to detect when the temperature is getting too warm (or too cold) for safe or optimum operation of the equipment. The rules engine, upon detecting temperatures outside of the acceptable range, shuts off the equipment in the enclosure.</p>"},{"location":"general/Definitions/#software-development-kit","title":"Software Development Kit","text":"<p>In EdgeX, a software development kit (or SDK) is a library or module to be incorporated into a new micro service.

Additional methodologies (e.g. 12 factor apps), tools (e.g. Prometheus) and techniques (e.g., service discovery and service mesh mechanisms) have emerged to refine (some might say improve) the cloud native approach.

From the beginning of the project, micro services offered a means to provide an edge/IoT application platform based on loosely coupled capabilities with well defined APIs. A micro service architecture allows the adopter to pick and choose which services are important to their use case and drop the others (critical in a resource constrained environment).  It allows EdgeX services to be more easily improved upon and replaced (often by 3rd parties and commercially driven implementers) as better solutions emerge over time.  It allows services to be written in alternate programming languages or using technologies best suited to the job.  The benefit of micro services can be very beneficial where flexibility is a driving force as it is in cloud and edge computing.</p> <p>APIs</p> <p>Each EdgeX micro service has a well defined API set.  This API set is what allows replacement services to be created and inserted with ease.  It allows for applications on top of EdgeX to be more easily created.  Over the course of its existence, this API set has seen only one major revision (and most of that revision was based on the inclusion of standard communication elements such as correlation ids, pagination, and standard error messaging versus a change to the functional APIs).  This speaks to how well the APIs are performing in the face of EdgeX requirements.  Furthermore, the REST API definitions are even serving as the foundation for EdgeX service communication in other protocols (such as message oriented middleware).  This is not unique as cloud native computing systems are also starting to embrace the use of service communications in alternate protocols as well as REST.</p> <p>CI/CD</p> <p>Through the efforts of some very talented, experienced and dedicated devops community members, EdgeX has enjoyed world class continuous integration/continuos development (CI/CD) since day one of the project.  The EdgeX devops team has provided the project with automated builds, tests, and creation of project artifacts (like containers) that run with each pull request, nightly (for check of the days work), or on a regular schedule (such as performance checks monthly to ensure the platform remains within expected parameters as it is developed).  As shown in cloud native environments, well developed CI/CD pipelines make sure EdgeX is able to \"make 'high impact' code changes, at frequent rates, and with predicable impacts and minimal work.\"</p>"},{"location":"general/EdgeX_CN/#sometimes-incorporated-cloud-native-ingredients-in-edgex","title":"Sometimes Incorporated Cloud Native Ingredients in EdgeX","text":"<p>The following elements of cloud native are often, but not always applied in EdgeX.</p> <p>Containers</p> <p>EdgeX supports (even embraces) containers, but does not require their use.  The EdgeX community produces Docker containers with each release - along with Docker Compose and Helm Charts for orchestration and deployment assistance.  Containers provide a convenient mechanism to package up a micro service with all of its dependencies, configuration, etc.  They are a convenient software unit that makes deploying, orchestrating and monitoring the services of an application easier.  However, there are environments where EdgeX runs that do not support container (or other containerized) runtimes.  Resource constraints (memory, storage, CPU, etc.), environmental situations (such as hardware architecture or OS), legacy infrastructure (old hardware or OS) and security constraints are just some of the reasons why EdgeX supports but does not dictate the use of containers.  Further, and perhaps most importantly, EdgeX often provides the middleware between operational technology (OT) - like physical equipment and sensors - and information technology (IT).  In the world of OT, there are physical connections and hardware specific touch points that need to be accommodated that make using a container in that instance very difficult.  Its not uncommon to see EdgeX adopters apply a hybrid approach whereby some of its services are containerized while other services are running \"bare metal\" or outside of any containerization runtime.</p> <p>Agile</p> <p>EdgeX has not adopted the Agile Manifesto, but the project does operate on Agile principals.  The community formally releases twice a year, but development of the product is ongoing constantly and any change (new feature, bug fix, refactor, etc.) is tested and integrated into the product continuously and immediately (through the CI/CD process mentioned above).  Formal releases are more stakes in the ground with regard to higher-level stability and agreed upon timelines for significant features.  The community has adopted a philosophy of \"crawl, walk, run\" to grow new features that support a requirements base - but with an understanding (even an expectation) that requirements will change and/or be more fully understood as the feature evolves and gets used.  While face-to-face meetings between community members are difficult given the global nature of an open source project, regular and frequent communications between the community developers/architects in and about the code is favored above lots of formal and comprehensive document exchange.  Developers are free to use the tools and processes that suit them best so long as the resulting code fulfils requirements and satisfies the CI/CD process.</p> <p>Distributed</p> <p>EdgeX is a micro service architecture.  Services communicate with each other via REST or message bus and that communication can occur across nodes (aka machines, hosts, etc.).  Services have even been built to wait and continue to attempt to communicate with a dependent service - allowing for some resiliency.  As such, EdgeX is, at its core, distributable. It was designed such that the services could operate largely independently and on top of whatever limited resources are available at the edge.  As an example deployment, an EdgeX device service could run on a Raspberry Pi or smaller compute platform that is directly connected by GPIO to a physical sensor, while the core services are run on an edge gateway, and the application and analytic services (rules engine) run on an edge service.  This would allow each service to maximize the available resources available to the solution.  Having said that, there are some complexities around real world distributed solutions that adopters would still need to solve depending on their use case and environment.  For example, while services can communicate across a distributed set of nodes, the communications between EdgeX services are not secure by default (as would be provided via something like a cloud native service mesh).  Adopters would need to provide for their own means to secure all traffic between services in most production environments.  Service discovery is not fully implemented.  EdgeX services do register with a service registry (Consul) but the services do not use that registry to locate other services.  If a service changed location, other services would need to have their configuration changed in order to know and use the service at its new location.  Finally, latency is a real concern in edge systems.  In addition to service to service communications, most services use stores of information (Redis for data, Vault for secrets, Consul for configuration) which could also be distributed.  These are referred to as backing services in cloud native terminology.  Even if the communications were secure, if these stores or other services are all distributed, then the additional latency to constantly communicate with services and stores may not be conducive to the edge use case it supports.  Each \"hop\" on a network of distributed services costs and that cost adds up when building solutions that operate and manage physical edge capability.</p>"},{"location":"general/EdgeX_CN/#cloud-native-ingredients-not-in-edgex-and-why","title":"Cloud Native Ingredients Not In EdgeX (and why)","text":"<p>Kubernetes</p> <p>EdgeX provides example Helm Charts to assist adopters that want to run EdgeX in a Kubernetes environment.  However, EdgeX was not designed to fully operate in a multi-cluster environment and take advantage of a full K8s environment.  Our example Helm Charts, for example, allow a single instance of each EdgeX service to be deployed/orchestrated and monitored, but it would not allow K8s to fully manage and scale EdgeX services.  Why?  First and foremost Kubernetes is large compared to the resource constraints of some edge platforms.  While smaller Kubernetes environments are being developed for the edge (see Futures below), a whole host of challenges such as resource constraints, environment, infrastructure, etc. (as mentioned under Containers above) may not allow K8s to operate at the edge.  Kubernetes is, for the most part, about the ability to load balance, distribute traffic, and scale (up or down) workloads so that an application remains stable.  But on an edge platform, where would Kubernetes find the resources to balance and distribute and scale?  Because edge nodes are static and often times physically connected to the sensors they collect data from, there is not the means to grow and/or shift the workloads.  Portions of EdgeX might be able to scale up or down (those not physically tied to an edge sensor), but the platform as a whole is often rooted to the physical world it is connected to.</p> <p>There are benefits (and challenges) to the use of Kubernetes that must be considered - whether used at the edge or in the enterprise..</p> <p>Some of the Benefits of Kubernetes - It provides a \"central pane of glass\" for placing workloads at the edge, monitoring them, and being able to easily upgrade them, more easily than a native, or Docker-based deployment. - It allows people to more easily deploy workloads that span from the cloud to the edge by using familiar tools that allow users to place their workloads in a more appropriate place. - Kubernetes is often choosen over Docker alone for container orchestration, with lots of commercially supported Kubernetes distributions for doing so. - Despite the fact that edge resources are not elastic, Kubernetes can make better scheduling decisions in a complex edge environment, where computational accelerators may be available on some nodes and not others, and Kubernetes can help place those workloads where they will run most efficiently.</p> <p>Some of the Challenges of Using Kubernetes at the Edge - Edge resources are not elastic - Some devices are physically connected to nodes using non-routable or non-Internet protocols, which reduces the value of the Kubernetes scheduler - Storage is a sticking point - unless there is enough infrastructure at the edge to make storage highly available, separation of the storage from the workload mathematically reduces availability (i.e: 0.9 x 0.9 = 0.81 !) - Available network bandwidth and latency can be a concern: a Kubernetes cluster generates a lot of background network and CPU activity.</p> <p>Serverless Functions</p> <p>EdgeX is not built on a serverless execution model.  Unlike the compute and infrastructure resources of the cloud (which can almost be thought of as infinitely available and scaled up or down as needed), edge compute resources and infrastructure are not scaled up or down based on demand.  An edge gateway, running on a light pole of a smart city for example, is not dynamic.  The gateway must be provisioned based on the expected highest demand of that platform.  The workload on the edge gateway must operate within those resource constraints.  EdgeX is designed to operate in some of the smaller of the static, resource constrained environments.</p> <p>Cloud</p> <p>Interestingly, we have been asked it EdgeX can run in the cloud.  Indeed, some services (such as application services or analytics packages like the rules engine) could run in the cloud (most of the services are platform agnostic), but EdgeX was designed to serve as the middleware between the edge and the cloud.  At the lowest level - EdgeX services are meant to connect the physical edge (IoT senors and devices of the OT world) to IT worlds.  EdgeX connects things that don't always speak TCP/IP based IT protocols.  EdgeX is meant to explore data at the edge in order to reduce latency of communication (making decisions closer to where the decision is turned into action) with the physical edge and reduce the amount of data that needs to be back-hauled to the world of IT (reducing the transportation and storage of unimportant edge data).  Even if physical sensors or devices are able to connect and talk to the cloud directly (perhaps because they have Wifi or 5G capability allowing them to connect via TCP/IP), the latency needs and cost to transport all the data directly to the cloud is typically prohibitive.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>There are some edge use case where a sensor-to-cloud architecture is warranted.  Where the sensor speaks well known IT protocols (TCP/IP REST, MQTT, etc.), the edge data collection rates are small, and there is no need to make quick decisions at the edge, a simple sensor to cloud architecture makes sense and would likely negate the need for EdgeX in that situation.</p>"},{"location":"general/EdgeX_CN/#other-cloud-native-aspects","title":"Other Cloud Native Aspects","text":"<p>Here are some  other aspects or thoughts associated to the cloud native approach (directly or by loose association) and how they apply to EdgeX. </p> <p>OS is separate</p> <p>As highly abstracted, containerized applications, cloud native apps do not have a dependency on any specific operating system or individual machine.  EdgeX is, for the most part, platform agnostic and able to run on any hardware, OS or connect to any type of sensor or cloud system (whether using EdgeX containers or running on bare metal).  However, there are some sensors/devices that require OS or hardware specific drivers or protocol support.  These specific services (typically device services) are OS dependent.</p> <p>High Availability</p> <p>While not strictly a cloud native principal, cloud native container apps are typically said to provide high availability (HA) - avoiding downtime (scheduled or unscheduled), often by taking advantage of cloud native infrastructure like Kubernetes to keep multiple instances of a service running when HA is paramount.  EdgeX does not offer HA out of the box.  Services are built to be resilient (for example, recovering from anticipated errors or waiting for dependent services to come up or return when they are not detected), but they are not guaranteed to be HA.  When EdgeX services are run in some environments the environment may detect service issues and launch a new instance of the service to prevent downtime, but these are features of the underlying runtime environments and not of EdgeX services directly.  HA often requires a certain amount of redundancy; that is keeping multiple instances of a service running (or at the ready) and using something like Kubernetes to route traffic appropriately given the condition of a service.  EdgeX does not have this infrastructure built in, and even if it did, it would have difficulty since some services are again tied to physical senors/devices.  If a device service connected to a Modbus device, for example, was to go down, then a backup/redundant service would be of little use without re-provisioning the sensor or device to the backup device service.  In order to provide true HA uptime with an edge solution that includes EdgeX, one would need to scale out not up.  That is, one would need to setup redundant hardware (sensors, gateway, etc.) with the edge application (EdgeX in this instance) connected to its copy of the sensors and devices and each transmitting back to the IT enterprise such that the enterprise could compare and detect when one of the copies was likely having issues.</p> <p>Would EdgeX ever explore buiding more HA capability into its services (or even some of its services)?  This is unlikely in the near term for the following reasons:</p> <ul> <li>The lack of clear use cases where adopters are demanding redundancy of capability all the way down to sensors</li> <li>the lack of clear use cases where the devices are active components in the system and the adopter is worried about missing data due to inability to capture and process it</li> <li>It is not cost-effective to manually code HA; the HA requirement would necessarily require building on a compute infrastructure like Kubernetes that is designed for HA, and eschewing support for native processes, and Docker that weren't designed HA.</li> <li>From a control perspective, there are challenges in having multiple components in the system the have the ability to make decisions (what if the multiple components make opposite and conflicting decisions)?</li> </ul> <p>Benefitting from Elastic Infrastructure</p> <p>Cloud native applications take advantage of shared infrastructure (hardware, software, etc.) provided by the cloud platform in an \"elastic manner\" - that is expanding or shrinking its use of infrastructure based on need (and not really availability which can be considered near infinite).  As previously mentioned, edge platforms rarely, if ever, provide this type of infrastructure.  Therefore, EdgeX is not built to benefit from it.  If an EdgeX service was to begin to receive more and more hits on its APIs, the service would eventually fail.  There is not EdgeX provided capability to scale out additional copies of the service.</p> <p>12 factor app</p> <p>EdgeX and its services are not 12 factor apps.  EdgeX does try to abide by many of the twelve factors (one codebase, declared and isolated dependencies, external config, isolated and configurable backing services, separate build, release and run stages, etc.).  But some of the 12 factors, such as concurrency (scale out via the process model), are not possible with each EdgeX service as already mentioned above.</p> <p>Observable</p> <p>Perhaps one of the greatest contributions of the CNCF community to cloud native computing is providing all sorts of tools and technologies to observe and analyze cloud native applications in the cloud.  Tools like Prometheus make monitoring cloud native containers and their resource utilization a breeze.  EdgeX does not come with native observability capabilities.  When using EdgeX containers tools like Prometheus for observability and analytics can be used to monitor EdgeX services.  Likewise, on some platforms and OS, there are ingredients (like Linux process status or system monitor) that can be used to help facilitate some level of monitoring.  But these are not provided by EdgeX, usually require additional work by an adopter, and may not provide the level of inspection detail required.  EdgeX is, with the Kamakura release, starting to provide more system level data (versus sensor data), metrics and events via message bus that an adopter can subscribe to in order to do more observing/analyzing of the EdgeX services.  This, however is raw data, to which some additional tooling will be required to provide either human or machine monitoring of the data on top to make sense of it.</p>"},{"location":"general/EdgeX_CN/#the-future-of-cloud-native-and-edgex","title":"The Future of Cloud Native and EdgeX","text":"<p>As cloud native computing technology and principals expands to more levels of our software realms and as the edge begins to become more indistinguishable from any other part of our computing network, it is inevitable that EdgeX will become more cloud native like.

You can also use it to control your devices - this is termed 'actuating' the device. When a device registers with the EdgeX services, it provides a Device Profile that describes both the data readings available from that device, and also the commands that control it. </p> <p>When our Virtual Device service registered the device <code>Random-Integer-Device</code>, it used a profile to also define commands that allow you to tell the service not to generate random integers, but to always return a value you set.</p> <p>You won't call commands on devices directly, instead you use the EdgeX Foundry Command Service to do that. The first step is to check what commands are available to call by asking the Command service about your device: <pre><code>curl http://localhost:59882/api/v3/device/name/Random-Integer-Device\n</code></pre></p> <p>This will return a lot of JSON, because there are a number of commands you can call on this device, but the commands we're going to use in this guide are <code>Int16</code> (the comand to get the current integer 16 value) and <code>WriteInt16Value</code> (the command to disable the generation of the random integer 16 number and specify the integer value to return).  Look for the <code>Int16</code> and <code>WriteInt16Value</code> commands like those shown in the JSON as below: <pre><code>{\n\"apiVersion\" : \"v3\",\n\"statusCode\": 200,\n\"deviceCoreCommand\": {\n\"deviceName\": \"Random-Integer-Device\",\n\"profileName\": \"Random-Integer-Device\",\n\"coreCommands\": [\n{\n\"name\": \"WriteInt16Value\",\n\"set\": true,\n\"path\": \"/api/v3/device/name/Random-Integer-Device/WriteInt16Value\",\n\"url\": \"http://edgex-core-command:59882\",\n\"parameters\": [\n{\n\"resourceName\": \"Int16\",\n\"valueType\": \"Int16\"\n},\n{\n\"resourceName\": \"EnableRandomization_Int16\",\n\"valueType\": \"Bool\"\n}\n]\n},\n{\n\"name\": \"Int16\",\n\"get\": true,\n\"set\": true,\n\"path\": \"/api/v3/device/name/Random-Integer-Device/Int16\",\n\"url\": \"http://edgex-core-command:59882\",\n\"parameters\": [\n{\n\"resourceName\": \"Int16\",\n\"valueType\": \"Int16\"\n}\n]\n}\n...\n\n]\n}\n}\n</code></pre> You'll notice that the commands have <code>get</code> or <code>set</code> (or both) options.

You can also call get manually using the URL provided (with no additinal parameters needed): <pre><code>curl http://localhost:59882/api/v3/device/name/Random-Integer-Device/Int16\n</code></pre></p> <p>Warning</p> <p>Notice that localhost replaces edgex-core-command here. That's because the EdgeX Foundry services are running in Docker.  Docker recognizes the internal hostname edgex-core-command, but when calling the service from outside of Docker, you have to use localhost to reach it.</p> <p>This command will return a JSON result that looks like this: <pre><code>{\n\"apiVersion\" : \"v3\",\n\"statusCode\": 200,\n\"event\": {\n\"apiVersion\" : \"v3\",\n\"id\": \"6d829637-730c-4b70-9208-dc179070003f\",\n\"deviceName\": \"Random-Integer-Device\",\n\"profileName\": \"Random-Integer-Device\",\n\"sourceName\": \"Int16\",\n\"origin\": 1625605672073875500,\n\"readings\": [\n{\n\"id\": \"545b7add-683b-4745-84f1-d859f3d839e0\",\n\"origin\": 1625605672073875500,\n\"deviceName\": \"Random-Integer-Device\",\n\"resourceName\": \"Int16\",\n\"profileName\": \"Random-Integer-Device\",\n\"valueType\": \"Int16\",\n\"binaryValue\": null,\n\"mediaType\": \"\",\n\"value\": \"-8146\"\n}\n]\n}\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p> A call to GET of the Int16 device's Random-Integer-Device operation through the command service results in the next random value produced by the device in JSON format.</p> <p>The default range for this reading is -32,768 to 32,767.  In the example above, a value of <code>-8146</code> was returned as the reading value.  With the service set up to randomly return values, the value returned will be different each time the <code>Int16</code> command is sent.  However, we can use the <code>WriteInt16Value</code> command to disable random values from being returned and instead specify a value to return.  Use the curl command below to call the set command to disable random values and return the value <code>42</code> each time. </p> <pre><code>curl -X PUT -d '{\"Int16\":\"42\", \"EnableRandomization_Int16\":\"false\"}' http://localhost:59882/api/v3/device/name/Random-Integer-Device/WriteInt16Value\n</code></pre> <p>Warning</p> <p>Again, also notice that localhost replaces edgex-core-command.</p> <p>If successful, the service will confirm your setting of the value to be returned with a <code>200</code> status code.</p> <p> A call to the device's SET command through the command service will return the API version and a status code (200 for success).</p> <p>Now every time we call get on the <code>Int16</code> command, the returned value will be <code>42</code>.</p> <p></p> <p>A call to GET of the Int16 device's Random-Integer-Device operation after setting the Int16 value to 42 and disabling randomization will always return a value of 42.</p>"},{"location":"getting-started/quick-start/#exporting-data","title":"Exporting Data","text":"<p>EdgeX provides exporters (called application services) for a variety of cloud services and applications.

Application Services provide the means for data to be prepared (transformed, enriched, filtered, etc.) and groomed  (formatted, compressed, encrypted, etc.) before being sent to an endpoint of choice or published back for another  Application Service to consume. The export endpoints supported out of the box today include HTTP and MQTT endpoints,  but custom endpoints can be implemented alongside the existing functionality.</p> <p>Application Services are based on the idea of \"Functions Pipelines\". A functions pipeline is a collection of functions  that processes messages (EdgeX event/reading messages by default) in the specified order. Triggers seed the  first function(s) in the defined pipeline(s) with the data received by the Application Service. A trigger is something like a message  landing in a watched message queue. The most commonly used Trigger is the MessageBus Trigger. See the Triggers section for more details</p> <p></p> <p>An Applications Functions Software Development Kit (or <code>App Functions SDK</code>) is available to help create custom Application Services.  Currently, the only SDK supported language is Golang, with the intention that community developed and supported SDKs may come in the  future for other languages. The SDK is available as a Golang module to remain operating system (OS) agnostic and to comply with the latest EdgeX guidelines on dependency management.</p> <p>Any application built on top of the Application Functions SDK is considered an Application Service.

The SDK provides many standard functions  that can be used in a functions pipeline. Additionally, developers can implement their own custom pipeline functions and add those to  their Application Service functions pipeline(s).</p> <p>Example functions pipeline</p> <p></p> <p>One of the most common use cases for working with data that comes from the MessageBus is to filter data down to what is relevant for a given application and to format it. To help facilitate this, six primary pipeline functions are included in the SDK. </p> <ul> <li>The first is the <code>FilterByProfileName</code> function which will remove events that do or do not match the configured <code>ProfileNames</code> and execution of the pipeline will cease if no event remains after filtering.</li> <li>The second is the <code>FilterByDeviceName</code> function which will remove events that do or do not match the configured <code>DeviceNames</code> and execution of the pipeline will cease if no event remains after filtering.  </li> <li>The third is the <code>FilterBySourceName</code> function which will remove events that do or do not match the configured <code>SourceNames</code> and execution of the pipeline will cease if no event remains after filtering. A <code>SourceName</code> is the name of the source (command or resource) that the Event was created from. </li> <li>The fourth is the <code>FilterByResourceName</code> which exhibits the same behavior as <code>DeviceNameFilter</code> except filtering the event's <code>Readings</code> on <code>ResourceName</code> instead of <code>DeviceName</code>. Execution of the pipeline will cease if no readings remain after filtering. </li> <li>The fifth and sixth provided functions in the SDK transform the data received to either XML or JSON by calling <code>XMLTransform</code> or <code>JSONTransform</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Typically, after filtering and transforming the data as needed, exporting is the last step in a pipeline to ship the data where it needs to go. There are three primary functions included in the SDK to help facilitate this. The first and second are the<code>HTTPPost/HTTPPut</code> functions that will POST/PUT the provided data to a specified endpoint, and the third is an <code>MQTTSecretSend()</code> function that will publish the provided data to a MQTT Broker as specified in the configuration.</p> <p>See Built-in Pipeline Functions section for full list of SDK supplied pipeline functions </p> <p>Note</p> <p>The App SDK provides much more functionality than just filtering, formatting and exporting.

A functions pipeline is a collection of various functions that process the data in the order that you've specified. The functions pipeline is executed by the specified trigger in the <code>configuration.yaml</code> . The first function in the pipeline is called with the event that triggered the pipeline (ex. <code>dtos.Event</code>). Each successive call in the pipeline is called with the return result of the previous function. Let's take a look at a simple example that creates a pipeline to filter particular device ids and subsequently transform the data to XML: <pre><code>package main\n\nimport (\n\"errors\"\n\"fmt\"\n\"os\"\n\n\"github.com/edgexfoundry/app-functions-sdk-go/v3/pkg\"\n\"github.com/edgexfoundry/app-functions-sdk-go/v3/pkg/interfaces\"\n\"github.com/edgexfoundry/app-functions-sdk-go/v3/pkg/transforms\"\n)\n\nconst (\nserviceKey = \"app-simple-filter-xml\"\n)\n\nfunc main() {\n// turn off secure mode for examples. Not recommended for production\n_ = os.Setenv(\"EDGEX_SECURITY_SECRET_STORE\", \"false\")\n\n// 1) First thing to do is to create a new instance of an EdgeX Application Service.\nservice, ok := pkg.NewAppService(serviceKey)\nif !ok {\nos.Exit(-1)\n}\n\n// Leverage the built-in logging service in EdgeX\nlc := service.LoggingClient()\n\n// 2) shows how to access the application's specific configuration settings.\ndeviceNames, err := service.GetAppSettingStrings(\"DeviceNames\")\nif err != nil {\nlc.Error(err.Error())\nos.Exit(-1)\n}\n\nlc.Info(fmt.Sprintf(\"Filtering for devices %v\", deviceNames))\n\n// 3) This is our pipeline configuration, the collection of functions to\n// execute every time an event is triggered.\nif err := service.SetDefaultFunctionsPipeline(\ntransforms.NewFilterFor(deviceNames).FilterByDeviceName,\ntransforms.NewConversion().TransformToXML\n); err != nil {\nlc.Errorf(\"SetDefaultFunctionsPipeline returned error: %s\", err.Error())\nos.Exit(-1)\n}\n\n// 4) Lastly, we'll go ahead and tell the SDK to \"start\" and begin listening for events\n// to trigger the pipeline.\nerr = service.Run()\nif err != nil {\nlc.Errorf(\"Run returned error: %s\", err.Error())\nos.Exit(-1)\n}\n\n// Do any required cleanup here\n\nos.Exit(0)\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>The above example is meant to merely demonstrate the structure of your application. Notice that the output of the last function is not available anywhere inside this application. You must provide a function in order to work with the data from the previous function. Let's go ahead and add the following function that prints the output to the console.</p> <p><pre><code>func printXMLToConsole(ctx interfaces.AppFunctionContext, data interface{}) (bool, interface{}) {\n// Leverage the built-in logging service in EdgeX\nlc := ctx.LoggingClient()\n\nif data == nil {\nreturn false, errors.New(\"printXMLToConsole: No data received\")\n}\n\nxml, ok := data.(string)\nif !ok {\nreturn false, errors.New(\"printXMLToConsole: Data received is not the expected 'string' type\")\n}\n\nprintln(xml)\nreturn true, nil\n}\n</code></pre> After placing the above function in your code, the next step is to modify the pipeline to call this function:</p> <p><pre><code>if err := service.SetDefaultFunctionsPipeline(\ntransforms.NewFilterFor(deviceNames).FilterByDeviceName,\ntransforms.NewConversion().TransformToXML,\nprintXMLToConsole //notice this is not a function call, but simply a function pointer. \n); err != nil {\n...\n}\n</code></pre> Set the Trigger type to <code>http</code> in configuration file found here: res/configuration.yaml</p> <pre><code>Trigger:\nType: http\n</code></pre> <p>Using PostMan or curl send the following JSON to <code>localhost:&lt;port&gt;/api/v3/trigger</code></p> <pre><code>{\n\"requestId\": \"82eb2e26-0f24-48ba-ae4c-de9dac3fb9bc\",\n\"apiVersion\" : \"v3\",\n\"event\": {\n\"apiVersion\" : \"v3\",\n\"deviceName\": \"Random-Float-Device\",\n\"profileName\": \"Random-Float-Device\",\n\"sourceName\" : \"Float32\",\n\"origin\": 1540855006456,\n\"id\": \"94eb2e26-0f24-5555-2222-de9dac3fb228\",\n\"readings\": [\n{\n\"apiVersion\" : \"v3\",\n\"resourceName\": \"Float32\",\n\"profileName\": \"Random-Float-Device\",\n\"deviceName\": \"Random-Float-Device\",\n\"value\": \"76677\",\n\"origin\": 1540855006469,\n\"ValueType\": \"Float32\",\n\"id\": \"82eb2e36-0f24-48aa-ae4c-de9dac3fb920\"\n}\n]\n}\n}\n</code></pre> <p>After making the above modifications, you should now see data printing out to the console in XML when an event is triggered.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>You can find this complete example \"Simple Filter XML\" and more examples located in the examples section.</p> <p>Up until this point, the pipeline has been triggered by an event over HTTP and the data at the end of that pipeline lands in the last function specified. In the example, data ends up printed to the console. Perhaps we'd like to send the data back to where it came from. In the case of an HTTP trigger, this would be the HTTP response. In the case of  EdgeX MessageBus, this could be a new topic to send the data back to the MessageBus for other applications that wish to receive it. To do this, simply call <code>ctx.SetResponseData(data []byte)</code> passing in the data you wish to \"respond\" with. In the above <code>printXMLToConsole(...)</code> function, replace <code>println(xml)</code> with <code>ctx.SetResponseData([]byte(xml))</code>. You should now see the response in your postman window when testing the pipeline.</p> <p>Note</p> <p>The App Functions SDK contains a quick start template for creating new custom application services.

In non-frequency Hopping regulatory regions, this element is required,   while in frequency Hopping regions, this element is ignored.   In the first case, the service must tell the Reader what frequency to operate,   but some regions allow different power levels at different frequencies.   For these Readers, the service will only choose a Frequency from this list,   or will reject the Behavior if the Reader lacks any matching frequencies.   The US is a Hopping region, so this value is ignored for a Reader legal to operate in the US.</li> <li><code>GPITrigger</code> is an optional object that configures a GPI trigger.   When the service receives a <code>start</code> command,   rather than starting the Behavior right away,   the service tells the Reader to read   whenever a GPI pin switches to a certain state.   Likewise, the service handles <code>stop</code> by disabling the config on the Reader.   The required elements match that of the LLRP structure:<ul> <li><code>Port</code> is a uint16 port number.</li> <li><code>Event</code> is a bool with meaning for the GPI</li> <li><code>Timeout</code> is a uint32 number of milliseconds after which the trigger times out;   if it's 0, it never times out.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><code>ImpinjOptions</code> is an optional object with values that only apply   if the target Reader supports them:</p> <ul> <li><code>SuppressMonza</code> is a boolean that, if true, enables Impinj's \"TagFocus\" feature.   When an Impinj reader uses this mode and singulates tags in \"Session 1\"   (a concept that applies to the EPCGlobal Gen2 standard),   it refreshes Monza tags' S1 flag to the \"B state\",   so those tags are inventoried only once when they enter the antenna's FoV.   When this option is enabled on a Behavior,   the service changes its <code>Fast</code> and <code>Normal</code> scans to use this.   Since a <code>Deep</code> scan already attempts to keep all tags quiet   until it inventories the full tag population,   this option doesn't have an effect when the <code>ScanType</code> is <code>Deep</code>.</li> </ul> <p>Note that this feature only works on Impinj Monza tags   when they're being read by an Impinj Reader;   other readers are not configured with this option,   and other tag types will act as they do under a <code>Normal</code> scan.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"microservices/application/services/AppLLRPInventory/details/Behaviors/#device-profile-requirements","title":"Device Profile Requirements","text":"<p>As mentioned above, this service calls the Device Service with specific <code>deviceCommands</code> and expects specific <code>deviceResources</code>.

Core data persists the data in a local database. Redis is used by default, but a database abstraction layer allows for other database implementations to be added.</p> <p></p> <p>Other services and systems, both EdgeX specific and external, access the sensor data through the core data service.

Device services can send data via message bus directly to application services.  If local persistence is not needed, the service can be removed.</p> <p>If persistence is needed, sensor data can be sent via message bus to core data which then persists the data.  See below for more details.</p> <p>Sensor data can be sent to core data via two different means:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Services (like devices services) and other systems can put sensor data on a message bus topic and core data can be configured to subscribed to that topic.     This is the default means of getting data to core data.     Any service (like an application service or rules engine service) or 3rd system could also subscribe to the same topic.     If the sensor data does not need to persisted locally, core data does not have to subscribe to the message bus topic - making core data completely optional.     By default, the message bus is implemented using Redis Pub/Sub.     MQTT can be used as an alternate message bus implementation.         </p> </li> <li> <p>Services and systems can call on the core data REST API to send data to core data and have the data put in local storage.

They serve no real purpose inside of EdgeX.</p> <p>A device resource (in the deviceResources section of the YAML file) specifies a sensor value within a device that may be read from or written to either individually or as part of a device command (see below).  Think of a device resource as a specific value that can be obtained from the underlying device or a value that can be set to the underlying device.  In a thermostat, a device resource may be a temperature or humidity (values sensed from the devices) or cooling point or heating point (values that can be set/actuated to allow the thermostat to determine when associated heat/cooling systems are turned on or off).  A device resource has a name for identification and a description for informational purposes.</p> <p>The properties section of a device resource has also been greatly simplified.  See details below.</p> <p>Back to the BACnet example, here are two device resources.  One will be used to get the temperature (read) the current temperature and the other to set (write or actuate) the active cooling set point.  The device resource name must be provided and it must also be unique in any EdgeX deployment.</p> <pre><code>name: Temperature\ndescription: \"Get the current temperature\"\nisHidden: false\n\nname: ActiveCoolingSetpoint\ndescription: \"The active cooling set point\"\nisHidden: false\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>While made explicit in this example, <code>isHidden</code> is false by default when not specified.  <code>isHidden</code> indicates whether to expose the device resource to the core command service.</p> <p>The device service allows access to the device resources via REST endpoint.

In other words, attributes are \u201cinward facing\u201d and are used by the device service to determine how to speak to the device to either read or write (get or set) some of its values. Attributes are detailed protocol and/or device specific information that informs the device service how to communication with the device to get (or set) values of interest.</p> <p>Returning to the BACnet device profile example, below are the complete device resource sections for Temperature and ActiveCoolingSetPoint \u2013 inclusive of the attributes \u2013 for the example device.</p> <pre><code>-\nname: Temperature\ndescription: \"Get the current temperature\"\nisHidden: false\nattributes: { type: \"analogValue\", instance: \"1\", property: \"presentValue\", index: \"none\"  }\n-\nname: ActiveCoolingSetpoint\ndescription: \"The active cooling set point\"\nisHidden: false\nattributes:\n{ type: \"analogValue\", instance: \"3\", property: \"presentValue\", index: \"none\"  }\n</code></pre> <p>The properties of a device resource describe the value obtained or set on the device.

In other terms, device services ingest sensor data provided by \u201cthings\u201d.  When it ingests the sensor data, the device service converts the data produced and communicated by the \u201cthing\u201d into a common EdgeX Foundry data structure, and sends that converted data into the core services layer, and to other micro services in other layers of EdgeX Foundry.</p> <p>Device services also receive and handle any request for actuation back to the device.  Device services take a general command from EdgeX to perform some sort of action and it translates that into a protocol specific request and forwards the request to the desired device.</p> <p>Device services serve as the main means EdgeX interacts with sensors/devices.  So, in addition to getting sensor data and actuating devices, device services also:</p> <ul> <li>Get status updates from devices/sensors</li> <li>Transform data before sending sensor data to EdgeX</li> <li>Change configuration</li> <li>Discover devices</li> </ul> <p>Device services may service one or a number of devices at one time. </p> <p>A device that a device service manages, could be something other than a simple, single, physical device.  The device could be an edge/IoT gateway (and all of that gateway's devices), a device manager, a sensor hub, a web service available over HTTP, or a software sensor that acts as a device, or collection of devices, to EdgeX Foundry.</p> <p></p> <p>The device service communicates with the devices through protocols native to each device object.  EdgeX comes with a number of device services speaking many common IoT protocols such as Modbus, BACnet, BLE, etc.  EdgeX also provides the means to create new devices services through device service software development kits (SDKs) when you encounter a new protocol and need EdgeX to communicate with a new device.</p>"},{"location":"microservices/device/DeviceService/#device-service-abstraction","title":"Device Service Abstraction","text":"<p>A device service is really just a software abstraction around a device and any associated firmware, software and protocol stack.  It allows the rest of EdgeX (and users of EdgeX) to talk to a device via the abstraction API so that all devices look the same from the perspective of how you communicate with them.  Under the covers, the implementation of the device service has some common elements, but can also vary greatly depending on the underlying device, protocol, and associate software.</p> <p></p> <p>A device service provides the abstraction between the rest of EdgeX and the physical device.  In other terms, the device service \u201cwraps\u201d the protocol communication code, device driver/firmware and actual device.</p> <p>Each device service in EdgeX is an independent micro service.  Devices services are typically created using a device service SDK. The SDK is really just a library that provides common scaffolding code and convenience methods that are needed by all device services.  While not required, the EdgeX community use the SDKs as the basis for the all device services the community provides.  The SDKs make it easier to create device service by allowing a developer to focus on device specific communications, features, etc. versus having to code a lot of EdgeX service boilerplate code.   Using the SDKs also helps to ensure the device services adhere to rules required of the device services.</p> <p>Unless you need to create a new device service or modify an existing device service, you may not ever have to go under the covers, so to speak, to understand how a device service works.

While the EdgeX community and the larger EdgeX ecosystem provide a number of open source and commercially available device services for use with EdgeX, there is no way that every protocol and every sensor can be accommodated and connected to EdgeX with a pre-existing device service.  Even if all the device service connectivity were provided, your use case, sensor or security infrastructure may require customization.  Therefore, the device service SDKs provide the means to extend or customize EdgeX\u2019s device connectivity.</p> <p>EdgeX is mostly written in Go and C.  There is a device service SDK written in both Go and C to support the more popular languages used in EdgeX today.  In the future, alternate language SDKs may be provided by the community or made available by the larger ecosystem.</p> <p>The SDKs are really libraries to be incorporated into a new micro service.  They make writing a new device service much easier.

With the Ireland release, that situation is now improved by adding required ACL token header <code>X-Consul-Token</code> in any HTTP calls. Moreover, <code>Consul</code> itself is now bootstrapped and started with its ACL system enabled and thus provides better authentication and authorization security features for services.  In other words, with the required Consul's ACL token for accessing Consul, assets inside Consul like EdgeX's configuration items in Key-Value (KV) store are now better protected.</p> <p>In this documentation, we will highlight some major features incorporated into EdgeX framework system for <code>Securing Consul</code>, including how the <code>Consul</code> token is generated via the integration of secret store management system <code>Vault</code> with <code>Consul</code> via Vault's Consul Secrets Engine APIs. Also a brief overview on how Consul token is governed by Vault using Consul's ACL policy associated with a Vault role for that token is given.

Consul service itself provides ACL system and is enabled via Consul's configuration settings like:</p> <pre><code>acl = {\nenabled = true\ndefault_policy = \"deny\"\nenable_token_persistence = true\n}\n</code></pre> <p>and this is set as part of EdgeX <code>security-bootstrapper</code> service's process. Note that the default ACL policy is set to \"deny\" so that anything is not listed in the ACL list will get access denied by nature. The flag <code>enable_token_persistence</code> is related to the persistence of Consul's agent token and is set to true so as to re-use the same agent token when EdgeX system restarts again.</p> <p>During the process of Consul bootstrapping, the first main step of <code>security-bootstrapper</code> for Consul is to bootstrap Consul's ACL system with Consul's API endpoint <code>/acl/bootstrap</code>.</p> <p>Once Consul's ACL is successfully bootstrapped, <code>security-bootstrapper</code> stores the Consul's ACL bootstrap token onto the pre-configured folder under <code>/tmp/edgex/secrets/consul-acl-token</code>.</p> <p>As part of <code>security-bootstrapper</code> process for Consul, Consul service's agent token is also set via Consul's sub-command: <code>consul acl set-agent-token agent</code> or Consul's HTTP API endpoint <code>/agent/token/&lt;agent_token&gt;</code> using Consul's ACL bootstrap token for the authentication. This agent token provides the identity for Consul service itself and access control for any agent-based API calls from client and thus provides better security.</p> <p>The management token provides the identity for Consul service itself and access control for remote configuration from client and thus provides better security.

Please see more details and some examples in Configuring Add-on Service documentation section for how to configure add-on services' ACL roles.</p> <p><code>security-bootstrapper</code> then automatically associated with Consul's ACL policy rules with this provided ACL role so that Consul token will be created or generated with that ACL rules and hence enforced access controls by Consul when the service is communicating with it.</p> <p>Note that Consul token is generated via Vault's <code>/consul/creds/&lt;role_name&gt;</code> API with Vault's secretstore token and hence the generated Consul token is inherited the time-restriction nature from Vault system itself.

The API gateway served to separate the outside Internet-facing network, which was \"untrusted\", from the internally-facing network, which was a \"trusted\".</p> <p>EdgeX 3.0 takes significant steps to put limits on that trust. Whereas in EdgeX 1.0 and 2.0, microservice security was enforced at the API gateway, in EdgeX 3.0 microservice security is now also enforced at the individual microservice level. EdgeX 2.0 already enabled authentication for third-party components such as the EdgeX database, the EdgeX service registry, the EdgeX configuration provider, the EdgeX secret store, the EdgeX API gateway and the EdgeX message bus,  but the EdgeX microservices themselves did not require authentication if the request originated from behind the API gateway. In EdgeX 3.0, even internal calls to EdgeX microservices now require an authentication token.</p> <p>Compared to EdgeX 2.0, the security footprint of EdgeX 3.0 is reduced through the removal of the third-party Postgres and Kong components and using a minimally-configured NGINX gateway instead. Measurements taken before and after show a ~300 MB savings in downloaded Docker images in the container version of EdgeX, and a ~150 MB reduction in memory usage. Achieving these impressive improvements to the EdgeX footprint unfortunately means that there are some breaking changes to API gateway authentication that will be detailed later.</p> <p>Although not a functional change, a significant addition to EdgeX 3.0 has been made in the form of a STRIDE Threat Model contributed by IOTech. This threat model takes an outside-in view of EdgeX, treating the EdgeX services together as a unit. The STRIDE threat model should serve as a good starting point for EdgeX adopters own threat models in which EdgeX is a component in the overall architecture. It should be noted, however, that since EdgeX services are taken together as a unit, the impact of the recent microservice authentication changes, which primarily affect EdgeX internals, is not reflected in the threat model.</p>"},{"location":"security/V3Migration/#api-gateway-breaking-authentication-changes","title":"API Gateway Breaking Authentication Changes","text":"<p>In EdgeX 2.0, the <code>secrets-config</code> utility was used to create a user account in the API gateway (Kong) and associate it to a user-specified public key. A user would then self-create a JWT, and use it for authentication against the API gateway. These tokens were opaque to EdgeX microservices because their contents were controlled by the user, and only the API gateway had the information needed to validate them.</p> <p>In EdgeX 3.0, the <code>secrets-config</code> utility is still used to create a user account, but instead of creating it in the API gateway, the user account is created in the EdgeX secret store, and the Vault identity secrets engine is used to generate and verify JWT's. All EdgeX services implicitly trust the EdgeX secret store and have a secret store token issued to them at startup that can be used to request a JWT from Vault.</p> <p>Externally-originated requests are performed similarly to how they were done before: provide the JWT in the <code>Authorization</code> header and direct the request at the API gateway with a path prefix denoting the desired service. The key difference is in obtaining the JWT. In EdgeX 2.0, the client simply generated the JWT using its private key. In EdgeX 3.0, obtaining a JWT is a two-step process. First, authenticate to the EdgeX secret store (Vault) to obtain a secret store token. Second, exchange the secret store token for a JWT. This process is described in detail in the authenticating chapter of the EdgeX documentation. Due to these changes, the <code>secrets-config proxy jwt</code> helper command has been removed. This same chapter also explains that, similar to Kong, Vault has an extensible authentication mechanism, although only username/password (with a randomized strong password) is enabled out of the box.</p> <p>As was before, all requests (with the exception of a passthrough for Vault authentication) are checked at the API gateway prior to forwarding to the backend service for fulfillment.</p>"},{"location":"security/V3Migration/#microservice-level-breaking-authentication-changes","title":"Microservice-level Breaking Authentication Changes","text":"<p>EdgeX microservices in EdgeX 3.0 will now require authentication on a per-route basis, even for requests that originate behind the API gateway. Peer-to-peer service requests (such as a device service calling core-metadata, or core-command forwarding a request to a device service) are authenticated automatically. This new behavior may create compatibility issues for custom components that worked fine in EdgeX 2.0 that may suddenly experience authentication failures in EdgeX 3.0. This new behavior may also create issues for 3rd party components, such as the eKuiper rules engine, because of its ability to issue ad-hoc HTTP requests in response to certain events. The main V3 migration guide contains specific guidance for handling eKuiper rules that call back in to EdgeX.</p> <p>To revert to legacy EdgeX 2.0 behavior--no authentication at the microservice level-- set the environment variable <code>EDGEX_DISABLE_JWT_VALIDATION</code> to <code>true</code>. JWT validation must be disabled on a per-microservice basis. This will not stop EdgeX microservices from sending JWT's to peer EdgeX microservices--it will only disable validation on the receiving side, allowing unauthenticated requests.</p> <p>For sending JWTs, custom EdgeX services have two basic choices. The first is to use one of the pre-built service clients in <code>go-mod-core-contracts</code>. The other is to to use the <code>GetSelfJWT()</code> method of the <code>SecretProviderExt</code> interface.

This introduces a requirement to establish an on-device PKI, and the consequent need to prevent compromise of TLS private keys and unauthorized issuance of TLS certificates. It is difficult to dynamically trust a new certificate authority as the trusted list of certificate authorities is often set at build time not runtime. An alternative is to trust a particular CA at build time, and to pre-populate the PKI during device provisioning.</li> <li>Vault requires a master encryption key to encrypt its database. This master key is generated when the vault is initialized and must be resupplied when Vault is restarted to \"unlock\" the vault. The implementation must ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Vault master key. Normally the vault is manually unsealed using a human process. In IoT scenarios, the vault must be unsealed automatically, which presents additional challenges.</li> <li>Services need to talk to Vault to retrieve their secrets. Thus, the service location mechanism that clients use to establish that connection must be trustworthy / non-spoofable. One option is to hard-code \"localhost\" or use DNS provided by container orchestration software. The problem is significantly harder if using an outsource service locator, like the Consul service location, as the trust in Consul then needs to be established.</li> <li>There is a general bootstrapping problem for the services themselves: clients need a Vault token to authenticate to Vault. The confidentiality, integrity, and availability of this token needs to be protected, and the token somehow needs to be distributed to the service.  If the client tries to pull the token from somewhere, there must be an preexisting mechanism to authenticate the request. Alternatively, the token could be pushed to the service before it is started: environment variable or files are common approaches.  Lastly, there could be an agent that sends the token to a service after it starts, such as by an HTTP API. (Reference: Cubbyhole authentication principles.)   In addition, the previously mentioned PKI problem applies here.</li> <li>The Vault storage itself must be protected against integrity and availability threats. Confidentiality is provided through the Vault master key.</li> </ul> <p>The secret management design for EdgeX can be said to be finished when there is a sufficiently secure solution to the above challenges for the supported execution models.</p>"},{"location":"threat-models/secret-store/background/#next-steps-for-edgex","title":"Next Steps for EdgeX","text":"<p>All parts of the system must collaborate in order to ensure a robust secret management design. What is needed is a systematic approach to secret management that will close the gaps between the AS-IS and TO-BE future state.  This systematic approach is based on formal threat model with the aim that the system will meet some critical security objectives. The threat model is built against a proposed design and validates the security architecture of the design.  Through threat modeling, we can identify assets, adversaries, threats, and mitigations against those threats.  We can then make a prioritized implementation plan to address those threats.  More importantly, for someone adopting EdgeX, the documented threat model outlines the threats that the framework has been designed to protect against and by omission, the threats that it has not.</p>"},{"location":"threat-models/secret-store/high_level_design/","title":"Detailed Design","text":"<p>This document gets into the design details of the proposed secret management architecture, starting with a design overview and going into greater detail for each subsystem.</p>"},{"location":"threat-models/secret-store/high_level_design/#design-overview","title":"Design Overview","text":"<p>In context of the stated future goal to support hardware-based secret storage, it is important to note that in a Vault-based design, not every secret is actually wrapped by a hardware-backed key. Instead, the secrets in Vault are wrapped by a single master key, and the encryption and decryption of secrets are done in a user-level process in software. The Vault master key is then wrapped by one more additional keys, ultimately to a root key that is hardware-based using some authorization mechanism. In a PKCS#11 hardware token, authorization is typically a PIN. In a TPM, authorization is typically a set of PCR values and an optional password. The idea is that the Vault master key is eventually protected by some uncopyable unique secret attached to physical hardware.</p> <p>The hardware may or may not have non-volatile tamper-resistant storage.  Non-volatile storage is useful for integrity protection as well as in pre-OS scenarios.  An example of the former would be to store a hash value for HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) in a manner that makes it difficult for an attacker to pin a different key.  An example of the latter would be storing a LUKS disk encryption key that can decrypt a root file system when normal file system storage is not yet available.  If non-volatile storage is available, it is often available only in very limited quantity.</p> <p>Obvious with the above design is that at some point along the line, the Vault master key or a wrapping key is observably exposed to user-mode software. In fact, the number two recommendation for Vault hardening is \"single tenancy\" which is further explained, in priority order, as (a) giving Vault its own physical machine, (b) giving Vault its own virtual machine, or (c) giving Vault its own container. The general solution to the exposure of the Vault master key or a wrapping key is to use a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to limit observability. There is currently no platform- and architecture-independent TEE solution.</p>"},{"location":"threat-models/secret-store/high_level_design/#high-level-design","title":"High-level design","text":"<p>Figure 1:  High-level design.</p> <p>The secrets to be protected are the application secrets (P-1). The application secrets are protected with a per-service Vault service token (S-1).  The Vault service token is delivered by a \"token server\" running in the security service to a pre-agreed rendezvous location, where mandatory access control, namespaces, or file system permissions constrain path accessibility. Vault access tokens are simply 128-bit random handles that are renewed at the Vault server.  They can be shared across multiple instances of a load-balanced service, and unlike a JWT there is no need to periodically re-issue them if they have not expired.</p> <p>The token server has its own non-root token-issuing token (S-3) that is created by the security service with the root token after it has initialized or unlocked the vault but before the root token is revoked. (S-4) Because of the sensitive nature of this token, it is co-located in the security service, and revoked immediately after use.</p> <p>The actual application secrets are stored in the Vault encrypted data store (S-6) that is logically stored in Consul's data store (S-7). The vault data store is encrypted with a master key (S-5) that is held in Vault memory and forgotten across Vault restarts. The master key must be resupplied whenever Vault is restarted. The security service encrypts the master key using AES-256-GCM where the key (S-13) is derived using an RFC5869 key derivation function (KDF). The input key material for the KDF originates from a vendor-defined plugin that interfaces with a hardware security mechanism such as a TPM, PKCS11-compatible HSM, trusted execution environments (TEE), or enclave. An encrypted Vault master key is what is ultimately saved to storage.</p> <p>Confidentiality of the secret management APIs is established using server-side TLS.  The PKI initialization component is responsible for generating a root certificate authority (S-8), one or more intermediate certificate authorities (S-9), and several leaf certificates (S-10) needed for initialization of the core services. The PKI can be generated afresh every boot, or installed during initial provisioning and cached.

Creation of a PKI is a multi-stage operation and care must be taken to ensure that critical secrets, such as the the CA private keys, are not written to a location where they can be recovered, such as bulk storage devices.  The PKI can be created on-device at every boot, at device provisioning time, or created off-device and imported.  Caching of the PKI is optional if the PKI is created afresh every boot, but required otherwise.</p> <p>If the implementation allows, the private keys for certificate authorities should be destroyed after PKI generation to prevent unauthorized issuance of new leaf certificates, except where the certificate authority is stored in Vault and controlled with an appropriate policy. Following creation of the PKI, or retrieving it from cache, the PKI initialization is responsible for distributing keying material to pre-agreed per-service drop locations that service configuration files expect to find them.</p> <p>PKI initialization is not instantaneous.  Even if PKI initialization is started first, dependent services may also be started before PKI initialization is completed.  It is necessary to implement init-blocking code in dependent services that delays service startup until PKI assets have been delivered to the service.</p> <p>Most dependent services do not support encrypted TLS private keys.

aspect of the Vault-based secret store architecture upon which the whole EdgeX secret store depends: the Vault master key. Because plaintext storage of the Vault master key at rest would be a known security weakness, the high level design calls for the Vault master key to be encrypted on storage.</p> <p>One way of doing this would be to simply encrypt the whole drive upon which the Vault master key is stored. This is a good solution: it would encrypt not only the Vault master key, but also other part of the system to harden them against offline tampering and information disclosure risks. This solution also has drawbacks as well: whole volume encryption may slow down boot times and have a runtime performance impact on constrained devices without hardware-accelerated crypto.</p> <p>The Vault Master Key Encryption feature of EdgeX enables a system designer to specifically target encryption of the Vault master key, and enables a variety of flexible use cases that are not tied to volume encryption such as key escrow (where a key is stored on another machine on the network), smart cards or USB HSMs (where a key us stored in a dongle or chip card), or TPM (security hardware found on many PC-class motherboards).</p>"},{"location":"threat-models/secret-store/vault_master_key_encryption/#internal-design","title":"Internal design","text":"<p>As stated in the high level design, an RFC-5869 key derivation function (KDF) is used to produce a set of wrapping keys that are used by the vault-worker process to encrypt the Vault master key.</p> <p>An RFC-5869 KDF requires three inputs. A change to any input results in a different output key:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Input keying material (IKM).

For instance, the same KDF can be used to generate an encryption key to protect the PKI at-rest.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The Vault Master Key Encryption feature consumes the IKM from a Unix-style pipe.

Review authorization settings. Justification: &lt;no mitigation provided&gt; Possible Mitigation: EdgeX services that use Consul must use a Vault access token provided in bootstrapping of the service. See https://docs.edgexfoundry.org/2.3/security/Ch-Secure-Consul/. There is also per service ACL rules in place to limit Consul access. As of the Ireland release, access of Consul requires ACL token header X-Consul-Token in any HTTP calls.

If tampered with, a sensor or device could be used to send the wrong data (e.g., force a temp sensor to send a signal that it is too hot when it is really too cold), too much data (overwhelming the edge system by causing the sensor to send data too often), or not enough data (e.g., disconnecting a critical monitor sensor that would cause a system to stop). EdgeX has no means to protect the \"wire\" to a physically connected device/sensor. Physical security is required to protect the wire and mitigate this threat. Additional optional mitigation ideas require modifications to the EdgeX device service. The device service could be constructed to filter data to avoid the \u201ctoo much\u201d data DoS. The device service can be constructed to report and alert when there is not enough data coming from the device or sensor or the sensor/device appears to be offline (provided by the last connected tracking in EdgeX).
