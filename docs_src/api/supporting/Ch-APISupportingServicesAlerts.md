# Alerts & Notifications

## Architecture Reference

For a description of the architecture, see
[Alerts and Notifications](../../microservices/support/notifications/Ch-AlertsNotifications.md)

## Introduction

When a person or a system needs to be informed of something discovered
on the node by another microservice on the node, EdgeX Foundry's Alerts
and Notifications microservice delivers that information. Examples of
Alerts and Notifications that other services might need to broadcast
include sensor data detected outside of certain parameters, usually
detected by a Rules Engine service, or a system or service malfunction,
usually detected by system management services.
