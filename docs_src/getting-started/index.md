# Getting Started

EdgeX Foundry is operating system and architecture agnostic. The community releases artifacts for common architectures. However, it is possible to build the components for other platforms. See the [platform requirements](../general/PlatformRequirements) reference page for details.

To get started you need to get EdgeX Foundry either as a User or as a Developer/Contributor.

## User

If you want to get the EdgeX platform and run it (but do not
intend to change or add to the existing code base now) then you
are considered a "User". You will want to follow the
[Getting Started as a User](./Ch-GettingStartedUsers.md) guide which
takes you through the process of deploying the latest EdgeX releases.

For demo purposes and to run EdgeX on your machine in just a few minutes, please refer to the [Quick Start](./quick-start) guide.

## Developer and Contributor

If you want to change, add to or at least build the existing EdgeX code
base, then you are a "Developer". "Contributors" are
developers that further wish to contribute their code back into the
EdgeX open source effort. You will want to follow the
[Getting Started for Developers](./Ch-GettingStartedDevelopers.md) guide.

## Hybrid

See [Getting Started Hybrid](./Ch-GettingStartedHybrid.md) if you
are developing or working on a particular micro service, but want to run
the other micro services via Docker Containers. When working on
something like an analytics service (as a developer or contributor) you
may not wish to download, build and run all the EdgeX code - you only
want to work with the code of your service. Your new service may still
need to communicate with other services while you test your new service.
Unless you want to get and build all the services, developers will often
get and run the containers for the other EdgeX micro services and run
only their service natively in a development environment. The EdgeX
community refers to this as "Hybrid" development.

## Device Service Developer

As a developer, if you intend to connect IoT objects (device, sensor or
other "thing") that are not currently connected to EdgeX Foundry, you
may also want to obtain the Device Service Software Development Kit (DS
SDK) and create new device services. The DS SDK creates all the
scaffolding code for a new EdgeX Foundry device service; allowing you to
focus on the details of interfacing with the device in its native
protocol. See [Getting Started with Device SDK](../microservices/device/sdk/Purpose.md)
for help on using the DS SDK to create a new device service. Learn more
about Device Services and the Device Service SDK at
[Device Services](../microservices/device/DeviceService.md).

## Application Service Developer

As a developer, if you intend to get EdgeX sensor data to external
systems (be that an enterprise application, on-prem server or Cloud
platform like Azure IoT Hub, AWS IoT, Google Cloud IOT, etc.), you will
likely want to obtain the Application Functions SDK (App Func SDK) and
create new application services. The App Func SDK creates all the
scaffolding code for a new EdgeX Foundry application service; allowing
you to focus on the details of data transformation, filtering, and
otherwise prepare the sensor data for the external endpoint. Learn more
about Application Services and the Application Functions SDK at
[Application Services](../microservices/application/ApplicationServices.md).

## Versioning

Please refer to the EdgeX Foundry [versioning policy](https://wiki.edgexfoundry.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=21823969) for information on how EdgeX services are released and how EdgeX services are compatible with one another.  Specifically, device services (and the associated SDK), application services (and the associated app functions SDK), and client tools (like the EdgeX CLI and UI) can have independent minor releases, but these services must be compatible with the latest major release of EdgeX.

## Long Term Support

Please refer to the EdgeX Foundry [LTS policy](https://wiki.edgexfoundry.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=69173332) for information on support of EdgeX releases. The EdgeX community does not offer support on any non-LTS release outside of the latest release.
