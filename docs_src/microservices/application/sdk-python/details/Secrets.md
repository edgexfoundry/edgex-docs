# App Functions SDK for Python - Secrets

[//]: # (All App Service instances running in secure mode require a SecretStore to be configured. With the use of `Redis Pub/Sub` as the default EdgeX MessageBus all App Services need the `redisdb` known secret added to their SecretStore, so they can connect to the Secure EdgeX MessageBus. See the [Secure MessageBus]&#40;../../../../security/Ch-Secure-MessageBus.md&#41; documentation for more details.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (!!! edgey "Edgex 3.0")

[//]: # (    For EdgeX 3.0 the **SecretStore** configuration has been removed from each service's configuration files. It now has default values in the code which can be overridden with environment variables. See the [SecretStore Overrides]&#40;../../../configuration/CommonEnvironmentVariables.md#secretstore-configuration-overrides&#41; section for more details.)

[//]: # (When running an application service in secure mode, secrets can be stored in the service's secure SecretStore by making an HTTP `POST` call to the `/api/{{api_version}}/secret` API route in the application service. The secret data POSTed is stored and retrieved from the service's secure SecretStore . Once a secret is stored, only the service that added the secret will be able to retrieve it.  For secret retrieval see [Getting Secrets]&#40;#getting-secrets&#41; section below.)

### Insecure Mode

When running in insecure mode, the secrets are stored and retrieved from the *Writable.InsecureSecrets* section of the service's configuration file. Insecure secrets and their paths can be configured as below.

!!! example "Example - InsecureSecrets Configuration"
    ```yaml
    Writable:
      InsecureSecrets:    
        AWS:
          SecretName: "aws"
          SecretsData:
            username: "aws-user"
            password: "aws-pw"
        DB:
          SecretName: "redisdb"
          SecretsData:
           username: ""
            password: ""
    ```

## Getting Secrets

Application Services can retrieve their secrets from their SecretStore using the  [interfaces.ApplicationService.SecretProvider.GetSecret()](../api/ApplicationServiceAPI.md#secret_provider) API or from the [interfaces.AppFunctionContext.SecretProvider.GetSecret()](../api/AppFunctionContextAPI.md#secretprovider) API

When in secure mode, the secrets are retrieved from the service secure SecretStore. 

When running in insecure mode, the secrets are retrieved from the `Writable.InsecureSecrets` configuration.
