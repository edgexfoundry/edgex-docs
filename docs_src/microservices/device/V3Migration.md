# Device Service - V3 Migration Guide

## All Device Services

This section is specific to changes made that impact only and **all device services**.

See [Top Level V3 Migration Guide](../../../V3TopLevelMigration) for details applicable to all EdgeX Services.

### Device Files

1. Change device definition file in the Device Service to YAML format.
2. Remove `LastConnected` and `LastReported` configs.
3. ProtocolProperties now supports typed values.

    !!! example "ProtocolProperty with typed values"
    
        ```yaml
        protocols:
          other:
            Address: simple01
            Port: 300
        ```

4. The boolean field `notify` has been removed as it is never used.
5. An extendable field `properties` has been added to Device. See [Metadata Dictionary](../core/metadata/details/DeviceProfile.md) and point to **Device tab** for complete details.
6. Added `tags` field to Device for event level tagging. See [Metadata Dictionary](../core/metadata/details/DeviceProfile.md) and point to **Device tab** for complete details.

### Device Profile Files

1. Add `optional` field in ResourceProperties to allow any additional or customized data.
2. Change the data type of `mask`, `shift`, `scale`, `base`, `offset`, `maximum` and `minimum` from string to number in ResourceProperties.

    > NOTE: When the device profile is in JSON format, please ensure that the values for `mask` are specified in decimal, as the JSON number type does not support hexadecimal. YAML does not have this limitation.

3. Added `tags` field in DeviceResource for reading level tagging. See [Metadata Dictionary](../core/metadata/details/DeviceProfile.md) and point to **DeviceResource tab** for complete details.
4. Added `tags` field in DeviceCommand for event level tagging. See [Metadata Dictionary](../core/metadata/details/DeviceProfile.md) and point to **DeviceCommand tab** for complete details.

### Provision Watcher files

1. The ProvisionWatcher DTO is restructured by moving the Device related fields into a new object field, `DiscoveredDevice`; such as `profileName`, Device `adminState`, and `autoEvents`.
2. Allow to define additional or customized data by utilizing the `properties` field in the `DiscoveredDevice` object.
3. ProvisionWatcher contains its own `adminState` now. The Device `adminState` is moved into the `DiscoveredDevice` object.
4. ProvisionWatcher can now be added during device service startup by loading the definition files from the `ProvisionWatchersDir` configuration.

    !!! example "Example Configuration"
    
        ```yaml
        Device:
            ProvisionWatchersDir: ./res/provisionwatchers
        ```

5. ProvisionWatcher definition file is in YAML format.

    !!! example "Pre-defined ProvisionWatcher"

        ```yaml
        name: Simple-Provision-Watcher
        serviceName: device-simple
        labels:
          - simple
        identifiers:
          Address: simple[0-9]+
          Port: 3[0-9]{2}
        blockingIdentifiers:
          Port:
            - 397
            - 398
            - 399
        adminState: UNLOCKED
        discoveredDevice:
          profileName: Simple-Device
          adminState: UNLOCKED
          autoEvents:
            - interval: 15s
              sourceName: SwitchButton
          properties:
            testPropertyA: weather
            testPropertyB: meter
        ```

6. An extendable field `properties` has been added to ProvisionWatcher. See [Metadata Dictionary](../core/metadata/details/DeviceProfile.md) and point to **DiscoveredDevice tab** for complete details.

## Custom Device Services

This section is specific to changes made that impact existing **custom device services**.

See [Top Level V3 Migration Guide](../../../V3TopLevelMigration) for details applicable to all EdgeX services and [All Device Services](#all-device-services) section above for details applicable to all EdgeX device services.  

### Dependencies
You first need to update the `go.mod` file to specify `go 1.20` and the V3 versions of the Device SDK and any EdgeX go-mods directly used by your service. Note the extra `/v3` for the modules.

!!! example "Example go.mod for V3"

    ```go
    module <your service>
    
    go 1.20
    
    require (
    	github.com/edgexfoundry/device-sdk-go/v3 v3.0.0
    	github.com/edgexfoundry/go-mod-core-contracts/v3 v3.0.0
        ...
    )
    ```

Once that is complete then the import statements for these dependencies must be updated to include the `/v3` in the path.

!!! example "Example import statements for V3"

    ```go
    import (
    	...
        
    	"github.com/edgexfoundry/device-sdk-go/v3/pkg/models"
    	"github.com/edgexfoundry/go-mod-core-contracts/v3/common"
    )
    ```

### Go Device Services
1. The type of ProtocolProperties is now `map[string]any` instead of `map[string]string` to support typed values.
2. Configuration file changes:
    - The configuration file is now in YAML format, and the default file name is configuration.yaml.
    - Add `ProvisionWatchersDir` configuration to support adding provision watchers during device service startup.
    - Remove `UpdateLastConnected` from configuration.
    - Remove `UseMessageBus` from configuration. MessageBus is always enabled in 3.0 for sending events and receiving system events for callbacks.
    - Remove Common config settings from configuration. See [V3 Migration of Common Configuration](../../configuration/V3MigrationCommonConfig) for details.
    - Internal topics no longer configurable. See [V3 Migration of Common Configuration](../../configuration/V3MigrationCommonConfig#messagebus) for details.
3. ProtocolDriver interface changes:
    - Add `Start` method. The `Start` method is called after the device service is completely initialized, allowing the service to run startup tasks.
    - Add `Discover` method. The `Discover` method triggers protocol specific device discovery, asynchronously writes the results to the channel which is passed to the implementation via `ProtocolDriver.Initialize()`. The results may be added to the device service based on a set of acceptance criteria (i.e. Provision Watchers).
    - Add `ValidateDevice` method. The `ValidateDevice` method triggers device's protocol properties validation, returns error if validation failed and the incoming device will not be added into EdgeX.
    - Update the `Initialize` method signature to pass DeviceServiceSDK interface as parameter.
4. Remove global variable `ds *DeviceService` in service package. Instead, the [DeviceServiceSDK interface](sdk/api/GoDeviceSDK/GoDeviceSDKAPI.md) introduced in Levski release is passed to ProtocolDriver as the only parameter in the Initialize method so that developer can still access, mock and test with it.
5. SDK API changes:
    - Add [`Run`](sdk/api/GoDeviceSDK/GoDeviceSDKAPI.md#run) method.
    - Add [`PatchDevice`](sdk/api/GoDeviceSDK/GoDeviceSDKAPI.md#patchdevice) method.
    - Add [`DeviceExistsForName`](sdk/api/GoDeviceSDK/GoDeviceSDKAPI.md#deviceexistsforname) method.
    - Add [`AsyncValuesChannel`](sdk/api/GoDeviceSDK/GoDeviceSDKAPI.md#asyncvalueschannel) method.
    - Add [`DiscoveredDeviceChannel`](sdk/api/GoDeviceSDK/GoDeviceSDKAPI.md#discovereddevicechannel) method.
    - Refactor [`UpdateDeviceOperatingState`](sdk/api/GoDeviceSDK/GoDeviceSDKAPI.md#updatedeviceoperatingstate) method to accept a `OperatingState` value.
    - Rename `AsyncReadings` to [`AsyncReadingsEnabled`](sdk/api/GoDeviceSDK/GoDeviceSDKAPI.md#asyncreadingsenabled).
    - Rename `DeviceDiscovery` to [`DeviceDiscoveryEnabled`](sdk/api/GoDeviceSDK/GoDeviceSDKAPI.md#devicediscoveryenabled).
    - Rename `GetLoggingClient` to [`LoggingClient`](sdk/api/GoDeviceSDK/GoDeviceSDKAPI.md#loggingclient).
    - Rename `GetSecretProvider` to [`SecretProvider`](sdk/api/GoDeviceSDK/GoDeviceSDKAPI.md#secretprovider).
    - Rename `GetMetricsManager` to [`MetricsManager`](sdk/api/GoDeviceSDK/GoDeviceSDKAPI.md#metricsmanager).
    - Remove `Stop` method as it should only be called by SDK.
    - Remove `SetDeviceOperatingState` method.
    - Remove the `Service` function that returns the device service SDK instance.
    - Remove the `RunningService` function that returns the Device Service instance.
6. Add additional level in event publish topic for device service name. The topic is now `<PublishTopicPrefix>/<device-service-name>/<device-profile-name>/<device-name>/<source-name>`
7. The following REST callback endpoints are removed and replaced by the [System Events](../core/metadata/details/DeviceSystemEvents.md) mechanism:
    - `/validate/device`
    - `/callback/service`
    - `/callback/watcher`
    - `/callback/watcher/name/{name}`
    - `/callback/profile`
    - `/callback/device`
    - `/callback/device/name/{name}`
8. Remove old metrics collection and REST `/metrics` endpoint.
9. Remove ZeroMQ MessageBus capability.

### C Device Services

1. There is a new dependency on IOTech's C Utilities which should be satisfied
by installing the relevant package. Previous versions built the utilities into
the SDK library. Installation instructions for the utility package may be found
in the [C SDK repository](https://github.com/edgexfoundry/device-sdk-c/blob/v3.0.1/README.IOT.md).

2. Configuration file changes:
    - The configuration file is now in YAML format, and the default file name is configuration.yaml.
    - Remove `UseMessageBus` from configuration. MessageBus is always enabled in 3.0 for sending events and receiving system events for callbacks.
    - Internal topics no longer configurable. See [V3 Migration of Common Configuration](../../configuration/V3MigrationCommonConfig#messagebus) for details.

3. The `type` field in both `devsdk_resource_t` and `devsdk_device_resources`
is now an `iot_typecode_t` rather than a pointer to one. Additionally the
`type` field in `edgex_resourceoperation` is an `iot_typecode_t`.

4. The `edgex_propertytype` enum and the functions for obtaining one from
`iot_data_t` have been removed. Instead, first consult the `type` field of
an `iot_typecode_t`. This is an instance of the `iot_data_type_t` enumeration,
the enumerands of which are similar to the EdgeX types, except that there are
some additional values (not used in the C SDK) such as Vectors and Pointers,
and there is a singular Array type. The type of array elements is held in the
`element_type` field of the `iot_typecode_t`.

5. Binary data is now supported directly in the utilities, so instead of
allocating an array of uint8, the `iot_data_alloc_binary` function is available.

6. Add additional level in event publish topic for device service name. The topic is now `<PublishTopicPrefix>/<device-service-name>/<device-profile-name>/<device-name>/<source-name>`

7. The following REST callback endpoints are removed and replaced by the [System Events](../core/metadata/details/DeviceSystemEvents.md) mechanism:
    - `/validate/device`
    - `/callback/service`
    - `/callback/watcher`
    - `/callback/watcher/name/{name}`
    - `/callback/profile`
    - `/callback/device`
    - `/callback/device/name/{name}`

8. Remove old metrics collection and REST `/metrics` endpoint.

## Supported Device Services

### Device MQTT

This section is specific to changes made only to **Device MQTT**. 

See [Top Level V3 Migration Guide](../../../V3TopLevelMigration) for details applicable to all EdgeX services and [All Device Services](#all-device-services) section above for details applicable to all EdgeX device services. 

#### Metadata in MQTT Topics

For EdgeX 3.0, Device MQTT now only supports the multi-level topics. Publishing the metadata and command/reading data wrapped in a JSON object is no longer supported. The published payload is now always only the reading data. 

!!! example - "Example V2 JSON object wrapper no longer used"

    ```json
    {
       "name": "<device-name>",
       "cmd": "<source-name>",
       "<source-name>": Base64 encoded JSON containing
    		{
              "<resource1>" : value1,
              "<resource2>" : value2,
              ...
            }
    }
    ```

Your MQTT based device(s) must be migrated to use this new approach. See below for more details.

##### Async Data

A sync data is published to the `incoming/data/{device-name}/{source-name}` topic where:

- **device-name** is the name of the device sending the reading(s)

- **source-name** is the command or resource name for the published data
    - If the **source-name** matches a command name the published data must be JSON object with the resource names specified in the command as field names.

        !!! example - "Example async published command data"
            Topic=`incoming/data/MQTT-test-device/allValues`
            ```json
            {
              "randfloat32" : 3.32,
              "randfloat64" : 5.64,
              "message" : "Hi World"
            }
            ```

    - If the **source-name** only matches a resource name the published data can either be just the reading value for the resource or a JSON object with the resource name as the field name.

        !!! example - "Example async published resource data"
            Topic=`incoming/data/MQTT-test-device/randfloat32`
            ```json
            5.67

            or
            
            {
              "randfloat32" : 5.67
            }
            ```

##### Commanding

Commands send to the device will be sent on the`command/{device-name}/{command-name}/{method}/{uuid}` topic where:

- **device-name** is the name of the device which will receive the command
- **command-name** is the name of the command being set to the device
- **method** is the type of command, `get` or `set`
- **uuid** is a unique identifier for the command request

###### Set Command

If the command method is a `set`, the published payload contains a JSON object with the resource names and the values to set those resources.

!!! example - "Example Data for Set Command"
    ```json
    {
       "randfloat32" : 3.32,
       "randfloat64" : 5.64
    }
    ```

The device is expected to publish an empty response to the topic `command/response/{uuid}` where **uuid** is the unique identifier sent in command request topic. 

###### Get Command

If the command method is a `get`, the published payload is empty and the device is expected to publish a response to the topic `command/response/{uuid}` where **uuid** is the unique identifier sent in command request topic. The published payload contains a JSON object with the resource names for the specified command and their values.

!!! example - "Example Response Data for Get Command"
    ```json
    {
       "randfloat32" : 3.32,
       "randfloat64" : 5.64,
       "message" : "Hi World"
    }
    ```

### Device ONVIF Camera

This section is specific to changes made only to **Device ONVIF Camera**.

See [Top Level V3 Migration Guide](../../../V3TopLevelMigration) for details applicable to all EdgeX services and [All Device Services](#all-device-services) section above for details applicable to all EdgeX device services.

#### Configuration

- Helper scripts have been deprecated in favor of using the REST APIs. 
See [here for camera credential management](../device/services/device-onvif-camera/Walkthrough/deployment.md#manage-devices), and see [here for configuring `DiscoverySubnets`](../device/services/device-onvif-camera/supplementary-info/auto-discovery.md#discoverysubnets).

#### Device Profile

Some commands have been renamed for clarity. See the latest [Swagger API Documentation](../device/services/device-onvif-camera/swagger.md) for full details.

- Get `Snapshot` command requires a media profile token to be sent in the jsonObject parameter, similar to `StreamUri` command.
- `Capabilities` command's `Category` field format is now an array of strings instead of a single string. This now matches the spec.
- Device Command `VideoStream` has been removed. It was never tested, and the same functionality can be done through the use of `MediaProfiles` and `StreamUri` calls.

### Device USB Camera

This section is specific to changes made only to **Device USB Camera**

See [Top Level V3 Migration Guide](../../../V3TopLevelMigration) for details applicable to all EdgeX services and [All Device Services](#all-device-services) section above for details applicable to all EdgeX device services.

#### RTSP Authentication

All USB camera rtsp streams need authentication by default. To properly configure credentials for the stream refer [here](services/device-usb-camera/supplementary-info/advanced-options.md#rtsp-authentication). This will require the building of custom images.  
To see how to use this feature once the service is deployed, see [here](services/device-usb-camera/walkthrough/deployment.md#add-credentials-for-the-rtsp-stream).
