# Friendly Name and MAC Address

Friendly name and MAC address can be set and retrieved for each camera added to the service.


## Preset FriendlyName
`FriendlyName` is an element in the `Onvif ProtocolProperties` device field. It is initialized to be empty or `<Manufacturer+Model>`
if credentials are provided on discovery. The user can also pre-define this field in a camera.yaml file.

If you add pre-defined devices, set up the `FriendlyName` field as shown in the `cmd/res/devices/camera.yaml.example`.

```yaml
# Pre-defined Devices
deviceList:
  - name: Camera001
    profileName: onvif-camera
    description: onvif conformant camera
    protocols:
      Onvif:
        Address: 192.168.12.123
        Port: '80'
        FriendlyName: Home camera
      CustomMetadata:
        Location: Front door
```

    "statusCode": 200
}
```
!!! Note
    Ensure all data is properly formatted json, and that all special characters are escaped if necessary


## Get Friendly Name

Use the FriendlyName device resource to retrieve `FriendlyName` of a camera.

```shell
curl http://localhost:59882/api/{{api_version}}/device/name/<device name>/FriendlyName | jq .
```
2. Response from the curl command. FriendlyName value can be found under `value` field in the json response.
```shell
{
  "apiVersion" : "{{api_version}}",
  "statusCode": 200,
  "event": {
    "apiVersion" : "{{api_version}}",
    "id": "5b924351-31c7-469e-a9ba-dea063fdbf3a",

## Preset MACAddress
`MACAddress` is an element in the `Onvif ProtocolProperties` device field. It will be set to empty string if no value is provided, or
it will be set with the MAC address value of the camera if valid credentials are provided.
The user can pre-define this field in a camera.yaml file.



If you add pre-defined devices, set up the `MACAddress` field as shown in the
`cmd/res/devices/camera.yaml.example`).

## Set MAC Address

MACAddress can also be set via Edgex device command.This is useful for setting the MAC Address for devices which do not contain 
the MAC Address in the Endpoint Reference Address, or have been added manually without a MAC Address. 
Since the MAC is used to map credentials for cameras, it is important to have this field filled out.

!!! Note
    When a camera successfully becomes `UpWithAuth`, the MAC Address is automatically queried and overridden by the system if available.

    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw '{
            "MACAddress":"11:22:33:44:55:66"
    }' | jq .
```
